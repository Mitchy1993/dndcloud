### Campestri of Silence

**Wondrous Item (Uncommon)**

#### Description:
This cute campestri is silently inhaling all sound. When held, it feels oddly heavy, and the air around it is unusually still. The Campestri of Silence is a prized organic item, capable of silencing even the most chaotic of environments.

#### Properties:
- **Silence Casting**: Once a day, when the campestri is squeezed, it casts an effect similar to the [[silence]] spell, centered on the location where the campestri was activated. The radius and duration of the silence depends on how forcefully the campestri is squeezed:
  - **Light Squeeze**: 10-foot radius for 1 hour.
  - **Moderate Squeeze:** 20-foot radius for 10 minutes.
  - **Strong Squeeze**: 30-foot radius 1 minute.
