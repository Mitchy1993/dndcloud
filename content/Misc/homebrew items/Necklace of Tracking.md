# Description
- The necklace glistens with an ethereal luminescence, crafted from delicate strands of silver and woven like moonlight into an intricate lattice. 

- Tiny, shimmering opals are set along the chain, each one glowing with a soft, otherworldly light. At its center, a heart-shaped pendant pulses with a gentle, rhythmic glow, containing a fragment of enchanted crystal that reflects the colors of a sunset.

- When worn, the necklace seems to hum softly, resonating with the presence of the loved one it seeks to find, guiding the fairy with an invisible, yet irresistible, pull.
