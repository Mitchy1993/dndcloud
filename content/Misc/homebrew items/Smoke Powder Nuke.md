*Wondrous item, legendary*  

The **Smoke Powder Nuke** is a rare and devastating explosive device powered by arcane-infused smoke powder. When detonated, it unleashes a massive explosion capable of leveling buildings and obliterating everything within its radius.

### Activation  
An artificier can  make this type of nuke to be armed with a command word or a timer, however anyone can rig a 15 second fuse and create this bomb with the proper ingredients and a barrel. Once activated, it detonates after a set duration or upon taking fire damage.

### Explosion Radius and Damage  
The explosion affects everything within a **75-foot radius**, with damage divided into three distance bands. Creatures that fail their Dexterity saving throw are thrown back **15 feet**.

- **Inner Band (0-25 feet)**:  
  **40d6 fire damage**, **DC 20 Dexterity saving throw** for half damage.  
- **Middle Band (26-50 feet)**:  
  **20d6 fire damage**, **DC 17 Dexterity saving throw** for half damage.  
- **Outer Band (51-75 feet)**:  
  **10d6 fire damage**, **DC 15 Dexterity saving throw** for half damage.

### Additional Effects  
- **Destruction**: All non-reinforced structures within the **25-foot** radius are destroyed.  
- **Deafening Blast**: The explosion can be heard for miles. Creatures within **150 feet** are deafened for 3 rounds if their ears were uncovered during the explosion.
### Ingredients
1. **Cindercrystal Shard**  
   - **Use:** Core explosive material.
2. **Elderroot Sap**  
   - **Use:** Alchemical catalyst to boost explosion potency.
3. **Blackthorn Ash**  
   - **Use:** Stabilizing agent to prevent premature detonation.
  4. **True Silver Filament**  
   - **Use:** Conductor to channel magical energy safely.
### Smoke Powder Nuke Construction Instructions
1. **Place the Cindercrystal Shard** at the center of the barrel. This will serve as the core explosive.
2. **Coat the Cindercrystal Shard** with **Elderroot Sap**, ensuring it is completely covered to enhance the explosion's power.
3. **Surround the shard with Blackthorn Ash**, forming a buffer around the core. This ash will stabilize the bomb and prevent premature detonation from external forces.
4. **Carefully weave the True Silver Filament** through the **Blackthorn Ash**, making sure it touches both the ash and the coated Cindercrystal Shard. Extend the filament out to the exterior of the barrel. The filament serves as the trigger, safely channeling magical energy to the core without risk of accidental detonation.
5. Seal the barrel tightly, ensuring the True Silver Filament remains exposed as the fuse. The bomb is now ready for detonation, with the filament delivering the energy directly to the core when triggered.
