#### **Origin of the Crown**

**[[Khurgorbaeyag]]'s Purpose:**
Khurgorbaeyag, the goblin god of slavery, oppression, and conquest, created the Goblin King's Crown as a divine instrument to unify and empower the goblin tribes. His aim was to consolidate his worship and increase his influence by establishing a mighty goblin kingdom on Faerûn. The crown was meant to be worn by a goblin king chosen by Khurgorbaeyag, who would lead the goblins to conquest and glory.

**Creation of the Crown:**
Forged in the divine fires of Khurgorbaeyag's domain in the Abyss, the Goblin King's Crown is made of dark, ancient metal and encrusted with blood-red gemstones. The crown is imbued with powerful enchantments directly tied to Khurgorbaeyag's divine essence.

**Power Contained in the Crown:**
- **Divine Command:** The wearer can use an action to emit a rallying cry. All goblins within 1 mile who hear the cry are charmed for 24 hours and will follow the wearer’s commands.
- **Khurgorbaeyag's Blessing:** The wearer gains a +4 bonus to Charisma (up to a maximum of 24) and can cast **Mass Suggestion** once per day without using a spell slot.
- **Aura of Conquest:** The wearer exudes an aura that boosts the morale of goblins within 120 feet, giving them advantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and resistance to fear effects.
- **Symbol of Unity:** Goblins and other goblinoids are automatically friendly to the wearer and are more likely to follow their orders.

#### Current Location and Possessor

**Location: The Ruins of Xûl'Grimdar**
[[Xûl'Grimdar]] was once the heart of a thriving goblin kingdom led by King Ghemne, the first and only goblin king to be chosen by Khurgorbaeyag himself. The kingdom was hidden deep within the land of [[Chult]], a bastion of goblin power and unity. From the isolation of their island the Goblin's could sail north to wreak havoc on coastal cities and sail back to the dense jungles to disappear to their hidden kingdom. 

Eventually, however, the kingdom fell due to betrayal, the ruins of Xûl'Grimdar were forgotten, overgrown by the dense forest.

**Current Possessor: [[Skarnak the Fallen]]**
Skarnak was one of King Ghemne's most loyal and powerful generals. During the fall of Xûl'Grimdar, Skarnak was mortally wounded. Desperate to protect his master's memory, he turned to dark magic and made a pact with Khurgorbaeyag, binding his soul to the ruins to protect the crown. The dark magic transformed him into an undead guardian, known now as Skarnak the Fallen.
