### Players Obtain the [[C.L.E.R.I.C. Remote]](DC 22 (INT) to learn how to give C.L.E.R.I.C.s new parameters)
*"As you hold the remote, it hums with arcane energy, but the symbols on it seem to shift and twist in ways that defy normal logic. Each button is marked with complex glyphs, some appearing as if they are written in a forgotten language, while others flicker between symbols from different magical schools. ""*
