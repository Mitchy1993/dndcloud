*Wondrous item (ring), legendary (requires attunement by the recipient)**

The Ring of Eternal Love is an ancient artifact, said to be crafted by deities of love and commitment. To obtain it, an individual must pass a series of arduous trials designed to test their dedication, bravery, and love. Once obtained, the ring can be given to a beloved, creating a magical bond that enhances their relationship in profound ways.

**Bond of Hearts.** The wearer of the Ring of Eternal Love and the giver share a deep, mystical connection. They can sense each other’s emotions and general well-being regardless of distance. This bond cannot be severed by any means, magical or otherwise.

**Shared Vitality.** When either the wearer or the giver is reduced to 0 hit points, they can draw on the other's strength to stabilize. The wearer can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead of falling unconscious. This ability can be used once per long rest.

**Telepathic Communication.** The wearer and the giver can communicate telepathically over any distance, as long as they are on the same plane of existence.

**Protective Aura.** The ring grants the wearer and the giver a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws when they are within 30 feet of each other.

**Eternal Light.** The ring emits a gentle, warm light that can be turned on or off at will. This light provides dim light in a 10-foot radius.

**Memory Keeper.** The ring can store up to five cherished memories. The wearer can touch the ring and recall these memories vividly. These memories can be shared between the wearer and the giver.

**Guardian’s Blessing.** Once per day, the wearer can call upon the ring’s power to cast the *Sanctuary* spell on themselves or the giver.

**Healing Touch.** The ring allows the wearer to use a special healing ability once per long rest. By touching the giver, they can heal them for a number of hit points equal to their own level.
