## Item Description
### Circlet of Intellect Guarding
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

This intricate silver circlet is adorned with arcane runes that subtly pulse with a soft, blue light when worn. The Circlet of Intellect Guarding grants its wearer and allies within a 30-foot radius protection from psionic threats, particularly from mind flayers.

**Psionic Ward:** As long as the wearer wishes, the circlet projects an invisible barrier in a 30-foot radius centered on the wearer. Within this zone:

- **Psionics Suppressed:** All psionic abilities, including spells with a psionic source, are disabled and cannot be activated.
- **Anti-Psionic Zone:** Any psionic attacks that attempt to enter the zone are automatically dispelled, even if the origin of the attack is from outside the zone.
- **Communication Block:** All psionic communication, both in and out of the zone, is blocked.

The circletâ€™s effects remain active as long as the wearer remains conscious and willingly maintains the protection. If the wearer is incapacitated, the effects of the circlet are suppressed until the wearer regains consciousness.
