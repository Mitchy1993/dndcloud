![[Brown Brief Case.png|500]]
A magical brief case with a permanent [[arcane-lock]] on it. It can be attuned to over 3 hours, but not while it is attuned to another creature.
- DC 23 Sleight of Hand to unlock while arcane lock is active.
The attunement is broken if the lock is breached with means other than the *password.*

The current password is: *Nanther*

- If picked up by a living creature, other than the attuned creature, a [[cube-of-force]] is cast on the brief case's initial location automatically, using the impassable version of the cube.
	- Creatures can make a Dexterity throw (DC 16) to dive away from cube of force to avoid being trapped inside of it.
- The attuned creature can dismiss the cube force 
	- The cube of force is dismissed automatically if the attunement is broken.
