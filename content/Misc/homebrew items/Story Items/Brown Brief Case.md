![[Brown Brief Case.png|500]]
A magical brief case with a permanent [[arcane-lock]] on it. It can be attuned to over 3 hours, but not while it is attuned to another creature.
- DC 23 Sleight of Hand to unlock while arcane lock is active.
	- Lock becomes impossible on a failure, until the password is used.
The attunement is broken if the lock is breached with means other than the *password.*

- Knowledge and use of the password allows a creature to end the attunement of the previous user if desired.

- If ***picked up*** by a living creature, without the permission of the attuned user, an [[alarm]] & [[cube-of-force]] activated is cast on the brief case's initial location automatically, using the *mental* version of the alarm spell directed to the attuned user and using the *impassable* version of the cube.
	- Creatures can make a Dexterity throw (DC 16) to dive away from cube of force to avoid being trapped inside of it.
- The attuned creature can dismiss the cube force 
	- The cube of force is dismissed automatically if the attunement is broken or 10 minutes pass.
