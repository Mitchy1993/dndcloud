### **Infernal Pact of Power**

**By the Will of the Archduchess of Avernus, this Covenant is hereby sealed between the Undersigned Mortal, hereinafter referred to as “The Recipient,” and **Zariel, Archduchess of Avernus, General of the Infernal Legions**, hereinafter referred to as “The Grantor.”**

**Clause 1: The Boon**
The Grantor hereby agrees to bestow upon The Recipient one boon of vague but powerful significance. This boon shall manifest within no more than three (3) days of the signing of this contract and shall align with The Recipient’s deepest desire, whether consciously known or unknown. The boon shall grant a substantial advantage to The Recipient in their current pursuits.

- The nature of the boon shall be at the sole discretion of The Grantor, though its impact shall be of notable consequence, either in the form of power, influence, or material gain.
- The boon will not exceed a level of influence that disrupts the balance of the Blood War or impedes Zariel’s command over Avernus.

**Clause 2: Compensation**
In return for this boon, The Recipient shall surrender their soul to The Grantor upon the moment of their death. Upon the cessation of The Recipient’s mortal life, their soul shall be claimed without resistance, barrier, or delay, and bound eternally to the war host of Avernus.

- The Recipient shall forfeit all future claims to their soul, which shall be consigned to eternal service under the banners of the Nine Hells, with particular loyalty to Zariel’s dominion.
- Any attempts to evade or delay this forfeiture will be deemed a breach of contract and immediately actionable (see Clause 6).

**Clause 3: Non-Interference**
No power, mortal or immortal, shall interfere with the manifestation of the boon granted by The Grantor. The boon shall be shielded from external manipulation, alteration, or revocation, save by The Grantor’s direct will.

- The Grantor retains the right to adjust the form or function of the boon if The Recipient’s usage of said boon contradicts the “spirit” of the contract, as determined by The Grantor’s judgment alone.

**Clause 4: The Recipient’s Obligations**
The Recipient agrees, by signing this contract, not to actively or passively seek loopholes or nullification through any means, whether arcane, mundane, or divine. Should The Recipient violate this clause by seeking to subvert the contract or remove its binding power:

- The boon shall be immediately revoked, and The Grantor reserves the right to enforce immediate punitive measures.
- Further, any act of direct aggression against The Grantor or interference in the Blood War will be considered a breach and enforced under Clause 6.

**Clause 5: Eternity’s Claim**
Upon the moment of death, The Recipient’s soul shall be delivered to The Grantor, without resistance or delay. The soul shall be inducted into Zariel’s infernal legions, serving in the Blood War for eternity.

- No higher, lower, or equal power shall claim dominion over The Recipient’s soul beyond The Grantor, and no appeal for redemption or reincarnation shall be entertained.

**Clause 6: Immediate Conscription to Avernus**
Should The Recipient violate or breach any provision of this contract, including but not limited to seeking to nullify the contract or misusing the granted boon, The Grantor reserves the right to immediately conscript The Recipient to the front lines of the Blood War.

- The Recipient shall be forcibly pulled from their current plane of existence to Avernus, the first layer of Hell, to serve as a foot soldier or other appropriate rank under Zariel’s command, regardless of their state of life or death.
- This conscription shall not await The Recipient’s natural death and is subject to immediate enforcement. The Recipient will serve in the Blood War for no less than one hundred (100) mortal years, or until The Grantor deems them sufficiently punished for their breach, whichever is longer.

**Clause 7: Interpretation and Enforcement**
The terms of this contract shall be interpreted strictly in favor of The Grantor. No ambiguity or unclear wording shall be interpreted in favor of The Recipient. The laws of the Nine Hells, as interpreted by Zariel, Archduchess of Avernus, shall govern this contract.

- This contract is enforceable across all planes of existence, including but not limited to the Material Plane, the Nine Hells, the Abyss, and celestial realms. No force may supersede the authority of this contract.

### **Final Clause: Signature**
*By signing this contract, The Recipient acknowledges full understanding and acceptance of the terms and waives any right to recourse, divine intervention, or reprisal.*

### **Hidden Loopholes for Clever Players**

Here are two subtle loopholes players could discover within the clauses:

1. **The "Spirit of the Contract" Clause (Clause 3)**:  
   While Zariel retains the right to alter the boon if The Recipient uses it in a manner against the "spirit" of the contract, this gives the Recipient an opportunity to act creatively. If the Recipient can cleverly manipulate or interpret the spirit of the agreement — perhaps by fulfilling personal goals in ways that still align with Zariel’s broader war efforts or her disdain for weakness — they may escape consequences while benefiting from the boon.

2. **The Duration of the Blood War Clause (Clause 6)**:  
   The Recipient, if conscripted into the Blood War for breach, must serve for “no less than one hundred (100) mortal years, or until The Grantor deems them sufficiently punished.” This creates a potential loophole: if the player can find a way to "redeem" themselves in the eyes of Zariel or serve her interests in a way that she finds valuable, they may be able to shorten their sentence or even negotiate a release. This redemption could involve tipping the balance of the Blood War in her favor, defeating a significant enemy of Hell, or proving themselves indispensable to Zariel’s cause.
