### Astral Vault of Preserved Essences

A powerful, legendary artifact designed to store and preserve organic matter:

**Features**
- **Extradimensional Storage**: The vault opens to a vast, pocket dimension capable of holding an extensive amount of organic matter, keeping it fresh and intact indefinitely.
- **Preservation Magic**: Each piece of organic matter placed inside is immediately subjected to powerful preservation magic, similar to *Gentle Repose*, ensuring it remains in perfect condition regardless of the time it spends within the vault.
- **Teleportation Anchoring**: The vault can be anchored to specific locations across planes, determined by it's attuned owner allowing the owner to safely transport its contents by using its built-in planar transportation capabilities.
- **Anti-Detection Wards**: The vault is shielded by strong anti-detection wards, preventing its presence from being easily discovered by mundane means.
