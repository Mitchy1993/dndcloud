While the stone is active it glows with blue enchanctement magic. Those who observed the stone within an antimagic field may be surprised to find that the stone is actually comprised entirely of dark green scales taken from the remains of [[Armanathra]]. It is kept in [[The Undercroft]] as an anchor for the wards of [[Blackstaff Tower]]
