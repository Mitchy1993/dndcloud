Wormwood, *sometimes referred to as absinthe*, was a species of fragrant herb sometimes encountered in the Realms.

Wormwood was among fragrant herbs and spices, used in creation and preservation of mummies. Notably, mummies created in [[Calimshan]] smelled of cedar resin, beeswax, sage, and *wormwood*.

Inhabitants of [[Hammerkeep]] in the North Faerûn distilled an alcoholic drink using anise, wormwood, and other fragrant plants. The resulting liquor – absinthe, was green and bitter to taste.

Wormwood, or *absinthe,* oil was valued at *500 golden coins per flask*.
