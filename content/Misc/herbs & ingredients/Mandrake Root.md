**Mandrakes**, also known asÂ **witchroots**, were a type of plant found in the Realms used by many seers, hags, witches and the sort for glimpses of the future or other divination based abilities.

Mandrakes have some base level of intelligence and theoretically can make speech, however in practice they seem hardwired to scream loudly when uprooted and then sleep peacefully until consumed.
