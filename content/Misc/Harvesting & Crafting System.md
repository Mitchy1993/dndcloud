## **Harvesting System**

- **When to Harvest**: Players can gather materials during downtime, after battles, or while exploring suitable environments (forests, caves, ruins, etc.).
- **Skill Check**: A skill check is required to successfully harvest materials. The type of skill check depends on the source:
  - **Nature**: For plants, animals, or natural environments.
  - **Survival**: For hunting creatures or gathering in challenging areas.
  - **Arcana**: Only allows harvesting magical materials; only usable on magical creatures or areas.

  *(DC decided by the DM based on the rarity or challenge of the source)*
