## Throw

**Action Type:** Action  
**Range:** Melee Only

You can attempt to throw a target. If the target creature is one or more size classes smaller you can throw the creature after grappling them with one hand. Creatures of the same size require you to grapple a target with both hands before a throw can be attempted. A throw requires you to make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by your target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If you succeed you throw the creature in a direction of your choosing. You cannot throw a creature of a larger size class.

You can throw a same-sized create up to ([Strength Modifier × 5] − 10) feet. This means that you need a minimum strength score of 16 to toss a same-sized creature 5 feet. When throwing a smaller creature your Strength Modifier is multiplied by two for every step down in size class.

**Example 1:** An Orc with 19 strength is throwing a half-ling. He can throw the half-ling up to ([2(Size Difference)×4(STR Mod)×5] − 10) = 30 feet.

**Example 2:** An Ogre with 19 strength is throwing a half-ling. He can throw the half-ling up to ([3(Size Difference)×4(STR Mod)×5] − 10) = 60 feet.

The thrown creature is treated as an improvised weapon that deals 1d6 per 10 feet thrown (rounded down) bludgeoning damage, to a maximum of 20d6, to both the thrown creature and the creature that is hit. Creatures hit by a thrown creature at least one size class smaller have resistance to the attack.

Characters with the Grappler feat have advantage on their throw check.
