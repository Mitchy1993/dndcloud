## **Armor Durability System**

### **Critical Hits and Armor Damage**
- **Armor Damage**: Armor only takes damage from **critical hits**. When a critical hit is scored on a character wearing armor, the armor's HP takes damage **equal to the total damage dealt** by the critical hit.
- **Armor Breaks**: If the armor’s HP is reduced to 0, it loses **1 AC** until it is repaired. This penalty stacks if multiple critical hits reduce the armor's HP to 0 again, but AC cannot drop below the armor's base AC minus 2.
  
### **Repairing Armor**
- Armor can be repaired at a smithy or by someone proficient with Smith’s Tools.
- **Repair Rate**: 10 HP of armor can be repaired per hour of work.
- **Repair Requirements**: Repairs at a smithy require a materials and labor cost (e.g., leather, metal, tools).
- **Cost of Repair**: Materials cost is based on the amount of damage sustained, as shown in the table below.

### **Examples in Play**
- A fighter in **chain mail (50 HP)** gets hit with a critical strike for **25 damage**. The armor’s HP is reduced by **25**, leaving it at **25 HP**. The armor still functions at full AC until its HP hits 0.
- If the armor’s HP drops to **0** after another critical hit, the **AC drops by 1** (from 16 to 15) until it is repaired.
- The fighter spends **3 hours** at a smithy to repair **30 HP** (10 HP per hour), costing **30 gp** in ***materials*** & ***labor***.

### **Narrative Balance and Repair Costs**
- **Light Armor** is inexpensive, and its repair costs are relatively high compared to its base price. This represents how easily replaced such simple armors are.
- **Medium Armor** offers moderate savings on repair, encouraging upkeep rather than replacement for more expensive options like breastplates.
- **Heavy Armor**, particularly **plate armor**, is significantly cheaper to repair than to replace, making repairs a valuable option for high-end gear.
