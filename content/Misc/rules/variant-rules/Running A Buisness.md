## Running a Business (Revised System)

This system outlines how characters can run a business and manage daily operations, profits, and events in a D&D game. The rules here make running a business dynamic and interactive, with meaningful player input and potential risks or rewards.

### Daily Business Roll (d100)

Each day, roll a **d100** to determine the profits or losses for that day. A result of **1-10** triggers a **Business Event**, which may have beneficial or harmful consequences for the business.

| **d100 Roll**  | **Outcome**                                                                                     |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1-10**       | **Business Event**: Roll on the Business Event Table (d20).                                       |
| **11-20**      | **Small Loss**: The business suffers a loss of 1d4 gp.                                            |
| **21-30**      | **Moderate Loss**: The business suffers a loss of 1d8 gp.                                         |
| **31-40**      | **Break Even**: No profits or losses today.                                                       |
| **41-50**      | **Small Profit**: The business makes a profit of 1d4 gp.                                          |
| **51-60**      | **Moderate Profit**: The business makes a profit of 1d8 gp.                                       |
| **61-70**      | **Good Profit**: The business makes a profit of 1d12 gp.                                          |
| **71-80**      | **Great Profit**: The business makes a profit of 2d8 gp.                                          |
| **81-90**      | **Significant Profit**: The business makes a profit of 2d12 gp.                                   |
| **91-99**      | **Exceptional Profit**: The business makes a profit of 3d12 gp.                                   |
| **100**        | **Major Business Evolution**: The business undergoes a permanent and significant improvement.     |

### Business Event Table (d20)

If a **Business Event** is triggered (rolling 1-10 on the d100), roll a **d20** to determine the outcome. Events add depth and challenge, requiring player intervention to resolve.

| **d20 Roll** | **Event**                          | **Effect**                                                                                                                                                        |

| 4            | **Disaster Strikes**               | Fire, flood, or another disaster damages the business. Repairing takes 1d6 days at **1d8 gp per day**. Players can halve the time and cost through intervention.    |

| 8            | **Tax Audit**                      | A tax audit occurs, requiring **1d4 days** to resolve. If ignored, suffer a **-10 penalty** to future profit rolls for the next week, and pay a **3d6 gp fine**.    |

### Active Participation

Players can influence daily outcomes by spending a full day managing the business. At the end of the day, they make a relevant skill check (DC 12). For every **5 points** above the DC, they add **+5** to the d100 business roll for that day.

#### Examples of Skill Checks:
- **Charisma (Persuasion)**: Attracting more customers or negotiating better deals.
- **Wisdom (Insight)**: Identifying and solving internal issues before they escalate.
- **Strength (Athletics)**: Enhancing productivity through manual labor or physical improvements.
- **Intelligence (Arcana)**: Using magic to streamline operations or attract business.

### Downtime Requirement

Characters must spend at least **1 full day** managing the business every **10 days** to ensure smooth operations. If they fail to do so, the business suffers a **-10 penalty** to d100 rolls until they return to oversee operations.
