### Overview of Renown
Renown is a numerical value that represents how much a character has contributed to or is recognized by a group or faction. Players can increase their renown by performing services, completing missions, or otherwise working to further the goals of their chosen organization.

As renown grows, characters might gain access to special benefits, such as titles, resources, influence, or missions. It offers a way for the DM to reward a character’s commitment to a faction and ties the character more deeply into the world of the campaign.

### Earning and Losing Renown
- **Earning Renown**: A character typically gains renown by completing quests or tasks that align with the goals of their chosen faction. A DM might award 1 to 3 points of renown depending on the difficulty or significance of the task.
  
  For example:
  - Completing a minor task for the faction (like protecting a caravan) might earn 1 point.
  - Major tasks that contribute greatly to the faction’s mission (like recovering a powerful artifact) could earn 2 to 3 points.

- **Losing Renown**: Characters can lose renown if they perform actions that hurt the faction's interests, betray the organization, or otherwise damage its reputation. Negative actions might result in renown being reduced, or the character might even be expelled from the faction.

### Renown Benefits
As a character's renown increases, they can unlock various benefits based on their standing within the faction. These benefits vary depending on the organization, but they can include the following:

1. **Rank and Titles**: Characters with high renown may be granted official titles or positions within the faction. This can come with special responsibilities or privileges, such as commanding NPCs or making decisions on behalf of the faction.
   
   Example: A character in a mercenary guild might rise from "Initiate" to "Commander" as their renown increases.

2. **Access to Resources**: High renown might grant access to resources like faction-owned safehouses, treasure, or even magical items. A religious faction might allow a high-ranking cleric to borrow a holy artifact, for instance.

3. **Special Missions**: As renown grows, characters might be entrusted with special or secret missions that require a high level of trust. These missions can have larger rewards but might also come with greater risks.

4. **Influence**: Characters with significant renown might be able to influence decisions within the faction. They could sway faction leaders or change the direction of certain missions.

### Faction Examples
In the *DMG*, examples of factions include groups like thieves' guilds, noble houses, religious orders, or political organizations. Renown systems are adaptable to different campaign settings and allow for deep role-playing potential, as characters can build lasting relationships with these groups.

For example, in a typical campaign, characters might build renown with a **church**, gaining benefits such as:
- **Access to Healing**: At a low level of renown, the character might receive healing services for free.
- **Divine Intervention**: At a higher level, the character might be able to request divine favors or blessings.

### Renown and the Story
One of the key benefits of the renown system is that it allows the DM to weave the factions more tightly into the story. Characters can have deeper and more meaningful connections to the world by having stakes in different organizations. It also helps DMs give players a sense of progression and influence that goes beyond combat or treasure.

### Incorporating Renown into Campaigns
- **Track renown**: A simple numerical system can be used to track each character's standing with a given faction.
- **Create unique rewards**: Tailor renown-based rewards to suit the factions in your campaign.
- **Incorporate faction politics**: High renown can lead to faction-related storylines, such as rivals within the faction, and political intrigue.
