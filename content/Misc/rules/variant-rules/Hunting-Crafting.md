### **How Crafting Works**

1. **Hunt an Animal**: Roll a Survival check to hunt an animal. On a success, you gain the relevant animal part. Failure against dangerous animals may result in damage.
2. **Combine with Enhancers**: Visit a professional, workshop, or store to combine animal parts with one of **four Crafting Enhancers** to unlock special properties.
3. **Crafting Outcome**: Using the correct enhancer allows you to craft the item and gain its unique properties.

## **Wild Crafting System (For Hunting-Crafting)**

### **Purpose**
This system applies when players combine animal parts and crafting enhancers in a way that does not align with an official recipe. Instead of specific effects, the system determines how long the item can function before wearing out.

### **How the System Works**

1. **Crafting Attempt**: When players craft an item without matching an official recipe, roll on the Wild Crafting table to determine how long the item will last.

2. **Roll a d20**: The player rolls a **d20** to determine the item's durability or lifespan.
   - Low rolls (1-7): **Short Lifespan** (item lasts for a brief moment or single encounter)
   - Mid rolls (8-14): **Moderate Lifespan** (item lasts for 1d2 days)
   - High rolls (15-19): **Long Lifespan** (item lasts for 1d4 days)
   - **Nat 20**: **Permanent** (the item is fully functional and stable)

### **Wild Crafting Lifespan Table**

| d20 Roll | Lifespan Category  | Effect                                     |
| -------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1-7      | **Short Lifespan**  | Breaks after the first use.               |
| 8-14     | **Moderate Lifespan** | Lasts for 1d2 days.                       |
| 15-19    | **Long Lifespan**   | Lasts for 1d4 days.                       |
| 20       | **Permanent**       | Item becomes fully functional with no lifespan limit. |
### **Wild Crafting Lifespan Examples**

**Short Lifespan (d20 roll of 5)**: The player crafts a stealth cloak using **Fox Fur** and **Moonstone Dust**, but it only works for until the next dawn before the magic fades and the cloak falls apart.
