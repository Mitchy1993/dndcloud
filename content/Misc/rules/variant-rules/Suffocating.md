A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).  
  
When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it is ***incapacitated*** and can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it ***dies***.  
  
*For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to be exposed to air before it dies.
