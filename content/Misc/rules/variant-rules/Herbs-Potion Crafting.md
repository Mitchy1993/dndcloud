## Wild Potion Outcome System
When a player mixes herbs and suspensions that do not result in a potion it creates a "Wild Potion"
### **How the System Works**

1. **Roll a d20**: The player rolls a **d20** to determine the general type of effect (negative, magical, or positive):
   - Low rolls (1-7): Major Negative
   - Mid rolls (8-14): Minor Negative
   - High rolls (15-19): Minor Magical (fun but harmless)
   - **Nat 20**: Unexpected Boon (a positive surprise!)
