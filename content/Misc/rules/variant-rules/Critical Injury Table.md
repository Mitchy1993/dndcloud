## Healing Procedures
- **Medical Care:** A House of Healing can usually repair most of these injuries within a week long hospital stay at a *hefty* cost.
- Some injuries require a simple [[lesser-restoration]], while other's require powerful healing like [[greater-restoration]] or [[regenerate]]

### Compound Effects
Rolling the same injury twice without having treated it causes it to become permanent unless, treated with top-tier magic like **Wish** or **True Resurrection**.
