# Acid (vial)
*Adventuring Gear*  

- **Cost**: 25 gp
- Range: 20/60 ft
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

When you take the attack action you can replace one of your attacks to throw a vial of acid.

Target 1 creature you can see. The target must succeed on a Dex saving throw (DC 8 +PROF + DEX) or take `2d6` acid damage.

Upon contact with anything the vial shatters and coats a 15 foot radius from impact in acid giving DIS ADV to DEX saving throws and - 1 to AC from DEX while a creature is in that area.
