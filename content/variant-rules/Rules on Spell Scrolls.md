## Spell Scroll Rules
### Difficulty Class (DC) Calculation

The base DC for the Arcana check is 10 + the level of the spell + 2(Levels beyond capability)
- If the character can normally cast the spell they do not have to roll.
- Spells that are beyond the character’s current spellcasting level, the DC increases by 2 for each level beyond their capability.

### Detailed Outcomes

1. **Natural 20:** The spell is cast as if the character were of sufficient level. No complications or penalties apply.

2. **Spell Casts Normally:** The spell is cast as written with full effect.

3. **Spell Casts at Reduced Power:** The spell is cast, but its effects are diminished:
    - **Damage Spells:** Reduce damage by half.
    - **Duration-Based Spells:** Halve the duration.
    - **Range-Based Spells:** Halve the range.
    - **Area of Effect Spells:** Halve the area of effect.
    - **Healing Spells:** Heal half the amount.

4. **Spell Fails in Comedic Fashion:** The spell fails in a non-harmful, humorous way:
    - Fireball: A small, harmless puff of smoke appears.
    - Fly: The caster hovers a few inches off the ground for a moment before falling.
    - Invisibility: The caster turns a random color instead of invisible.
    - The specific effect can be left to the DM’s discretion for added fun.

5. **Spell Backfires (Natural 1):** The spell backfires and affects the caster negatively:
    - Fireball: The caster is at the center of the explosion, taking full damage.
    - Fly: The caster is propelled 10 feet into the air and falls, taking fall damage.
    - Invisibility: The caster becomes extremely visible, glowing brightly.
    - Again, the specific effect can be left to the DM’s discretion.
