**Purpose:**  
To allow players to challenge a DM ruling once per session when they believe it significantly contradicts the established story or game continuity, ensuring the game remains enjoyable and consistent for everyone.

## Guidelines:

### 1. Invocation of the Veto:
- The group collectively has one veto available per session.
- Any player can invoke the veto to challenge a DM ruling that they feel is inconsistent with the story, setting, or previously established rules.
- The player must provide a clear reason why they believe the ruling conflicts with the established continuity or narrative.

### 2. Veto Conditions:
- The veto can only be invoked if a player believes the ruling significantly alters the story or established game rules in a way that feels unfair or out of character.
- The veto cannot be used for minor disagreements, such as disputes over small numerical adjustments or standard gameplay mechanics, unless these directly impact major narrative points or character arcs.
- The veto is meant to protect the narrative integrity and should not be used for strategic advantages or minor inconveniences.

### 3. Resolution Process:
- When a veto is invoked, the group takes a brief pause to discuss the issue.
- The player must articulate why they believe the ruling is problematic in the context of the story or game continuity.
- The DM will then explain the reasoning behind their ruling.

### 4. Outcome Determination:
- After hearing both sides, the group (excluding the vetoing player) will vote on whether to uphold the veto.
- If the majority agrees with the vetoing player, the ruling is overturned, and the game reverts to the status before the contested ruling.
- If the majority supports the DM, the ruling stands, and the veto is considered used for that session.

### 5. Respecting the Decision:
- All players, including the DM, agree to respect the outcome of the veto process.
- Discussions should remain respectful and focused on the continuity and enjoyment of the game.

### 6. Abuse Prevention:
- Players should use the veto responsibly, only in cases where they genuinely believe the ruling affects the story's integrity.
- The veto is not a tool for frequent or trivial disagreements. Misuse of the veto can lead to its restriction or removal from future sessions.

## Example of Veto Use:
- **Scenario:** The DM introduces a plot twist where a trusted ally betrays the party without any prior indication or build-up.
- **Veto Invocation:** A player believes this twist is inconsistent with the character's established behavior and backstory.
- **Discussion:** The player explains why the betrayal seems out of character based on previous sessions.
- **Resolution:** The group discusses the allyâ€™s actions and motivations. If the majority feels the betrayal was unjustified, the DM may reconsider the twist or provide additional context to align it with the story.
