## Tying Up a Creature W/ or W/O Assistance

1. **Grappling Requirement**: 
   - The grappler and each assisting grappler must first grapple the target to contribute.

2. **Size Restriction**: 
   - At least one grappler must be of equal or larger size compared to the target.

3. **Progressive Checks**:
   - Grapplers make contested Athletics checks against the targetâ€™s Athletics or Acrobatics.
   - **3 total successful checks** are needed, which can be from any combination of grapplers.

4. **Difficulty Increments**:
   - If there is only one grappler, failing a tying check means they must start over again.
       - If the target is grappled by multiple creatures, a failed check merely halts their progress, but others can continue their attempts. Total progress towards the 3 checks remains.

5. **Restrained Condition Impact**:
   - Target rolls with disadvantage if it is given the ***restrained*** condition.

6. **Breaking Free**:
   - If the target is not grappled by at least one creature, or no longer is grappled by a creature that is equal to or larger than itself in size, at any point then all progress on tying them up is lost.
7. **Completion**:
   - After 3 collective successes, the target is tied up and ***restrained***.
       - To escape, the target must make a DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check or receive help.

8. **Time Factor**:
   - Initiating a *"tying check"* takes a full action each time it is attempted by a grappler.
