# D&D Chase Rules Summary

## Initiating a Chase
- A chase begins when one or more creatures attempt to flee while others pursue.
- Use initiative to determine the order of turns.
## Movement
- Participants move and take actions on their turn as in regular combat.
- The maximum distance a participant can cover in a round is twice their speed if they use the Dash action.
# Dash Limits
- Each Dash requires a DC 15 Constitution check. On a failure, the creature gains one level of [[conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]].
	- At 3 Exhaustion a creature can no longer dash.
	- At 4 Exhaustion a creature can no longer flee or chase. 
		- A fleeing creature must make a final stealth attempt and is cornered on a failure.
## Complications
- At the beginning of each participant's turn, roll a d20 to determine if a complication arises.
- Complications can be tailored to the chase environment.
## Escape
- A participant can attempt to escape by making a Stealth check contested by the pursuers' Perception checks.
- The chase ends if the escapee successfully hides or outpaces the pursuers.
## Escape Factors Table
- Conditions can grant the quarry advantage or disadvantage on their Stealth checks to evade pursuers.

## Ending the Chase
- The chase ends when the pursued is caught, escapes, or the pursuers give up or lose sight of the target.
