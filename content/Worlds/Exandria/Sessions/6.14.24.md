### Cave Exit
- The group decided to bee line for the Husseldorf home
- Gideon darted off into the night using his incredible ranger skills to quickly navigate himself directly into... a trap 0_0
![[Gideon Falling.png]]
- The gang found Gideon trapped at the bottom of the bit and tried to rescue him before he was attacked by wolves, but they just made it worse!

**EVENTUALLY**, they got their stuff together and pulled him out of there!
### Reaching the House
![[Husseldorf House.jpg]]
- The group split up, with Gideon circling the front of the house
	- Gideon started a fire by sniping a oil lamp on the street causing it to spill into the grass below
	- This began to attract attention
- The remainder of the group headed inside the house and quickly bumped into [[Kara Husseldorf]]
- Kara told them that she'd found the Voss & June and that they were downstairs and that the group should go get them before it was too late!
### Spring the Trap
- Gideon wasn't having any of it and tried to force feed a truth serum to Kara, but she shrugged him off.
- Gideon told her to go down first, but she pretended like she didn't hear him for long enough that Tybalt got impatient and decided to jump down into the basement to confront the sisters.

### It's Not a Trap?
- The group got into the basement to find it empty.
- They encountered 2 statues and one was missing a gem for the eye socket
- The gang searched for the eye, and as they search under the rug, Tavin was attacked by a [[rug-of-smothering.png|Rug of Smothering]]!
- Gideon quickly jumped in to save him, but became wrapped up in it himself!

- The group eventually cuts the carpet to ribbons!

### The Trap
- The group notices that Kara is missing, and they are attacked by two Dopplegangers!
![[Voss, June, Kara (Dopplegangers).png]]
- They battle and defeat the Dopplegangers, but not before one of them shouts:
*"For Leilas!!!"* and kamikazes

- The devastating blast shook the basement, vaporizing the Dopplegangers, and as the smoke cleared.... Eldric lay gasping on the floor struggling to stay conscious.
	- Tybalt frantically rushed to Eldric's side to provide him his last healing potion anxiously trying to return Eldric's strength.

### Victory and a Clear Name!
- Meanwhile, Fang retrieved "Kara," who was also a Doppleganger and the party was able to find out that:
	- [[Cerberus assembly]] is power hungry
	- Dopplegangers are spies from the [[Kryn Dynasty]]
- [[Fryda Langer]] cleared the names of the party and thanked them for their participation in the investigation.
- They took Kara(*Doppleganger*) into custody for further interrogation
- The party located the *real* Voss, June & Kara who had all been taken captive by the Dopplegangers in a secret room in the basement
- The party decided to sleep in the Husseldorf house to keep Kara company through the night
### What is to come??...
- The party now has a few answers, but they ponder over whether or not their remaining questions will lead them along the same path or if this alliance has reached it's end.
#### Session End
