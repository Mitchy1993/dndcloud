**The Corvid Conclave**:

- Among her most trusted servants are the [[Corvid Conclave]], a group of powerful,  entities that act as her eyes and ears across the planes.

## The Raven Queen

The Raven Queen was a mysterious entity from the Shadowfell who was revered by the shadar-kai.

### Obsession with Memories and Essences

The Raven Queen was obsessed with collecting and observing mementos and fragments of memories and essences. Many sages speculated that she was, in fact, insane, interpreting her methods and behavior as little more than aimless curiosity or a desperate attempt to prevent her fragile existence from fading into oblivion. Others believed that her actions served a cosmological function, as she purified souls by forcing mortals to confront their fears and pains. It was thought that her true intentions were known only to the Lady of Pain.

### The Fortress of Memories

One of the Raven Queen's divine realms in the Shadowfell was a castle known as the Fortress of Memories. This castle was a place of overwhelming sorrow, filled with memories taken from mortals, fragments of dead deities, and material objects collected by the shadar-kai as offerings to her. The fortress was also home to apparitions of creatures and places tied to deeply emotional stories. Swarms of ravens would occasionally depart from the fortress, carrying her cryptic messages to distant corners of the multiverse and serving as the Queen's eyes and ears while away.

### Collection of Memories and Souls

The entire focus of the Raven Queen's existence centered on collecting memories and strong emotions, often associated with loss and tragedy. To achieve this, she sent shadar-kai across the far reaches of the multiverse, guided by her ravens, to await and witness such events unfold. These shadar-kai would then gather mementos like trinkets, memories from the living, and sometimes even the souls of the deceased, which they brought back to her. Additionally, the Raven Queen asserted dominion over the souls of all shadar-kai, which were said to return to her after their deaths.

### Creation of Shadow Magic Weapons

Legend also attributed to her the creation of the first weapons imbued with shadow magic. These sentient blades, such as the infamous Blackrazor, could be found scattered across many realms of the multiverse and had the unique ability to bond with their wielders. This distinction made the Raven Queen a highly sought-after patron among warlocks who followed the path of the hexblade.

### Adversaries and Conflicts

The Raven Queen faced several formidable adversaries:

- **Orcus:** The demon lord Orcus relentlessly sought control over the Shadowfell, hoping to uncover the Raven Queen's true name as a means to weaken her domain.
  
- **Vecna:** Vecna, a lesser deity from Oerth, envied the Raven Queen's abilities to manipulate souls and gather knowledge. He plotted to overthrow her and seize control of the entire Shadowfell, leading to frequent clashes with her shadar-kai followers.
  
- **Other Seekers:** Numerous wizards and necromancers coveted the Raven Queen's dominion and sought her knowledge, attempting to conquer the Fortress of Memories. They were consistently thwarted by her devoted shadar-kai defenders.

### Conflict with the Prince of Frost

The Prince of Frost harbored deep animosity towards the Raven Queen due to her involvement in the loss of his beloved, Sharaea. Sharaea, a powerful fey, had sacrificed herself to protect her mortal lover, leading to a series of events where she struck a bargain with the Raven Queen to safeguard her lover by casting her soul into the future. This act ultimately transformed the Prince of Frost, as he embraced darkness and freezing death to gain power, partly in defiance of the Raven Queen.

Despite their conflicts, the Raven Queen also saw potential in the Prince of Frost, desiring him as a potential exarch or even a consort, reflecting a complex relationship layered with rivalry and intrigue.
