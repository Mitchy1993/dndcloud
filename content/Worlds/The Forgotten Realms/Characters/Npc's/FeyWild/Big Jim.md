## Backstory 
The original chief Circle Caster in charge of the [[Raven Queen]]'s Ascension.

His motives were pure, he did everything right, but the betrayers ruined the Ascension and damned the Raven Queen and all his people the Shadar-kai to the Shadowfell and it broke something inside of him.

The Raven Queen never held it against him, but he holds it against himself and smoke TONS of Lily Pad powder to cope with his perceived incompetence which nowadays has manifested into actual incompetence â€¦ but really the only one holding him back is himself.
