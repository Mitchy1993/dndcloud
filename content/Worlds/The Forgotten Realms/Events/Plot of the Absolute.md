The [[Tav]] and his companions put a stop to [[Enver Gortash]] and his plot to use the [[Crown of Karsus]] to dominate an Elder Brain.

The Elder Brain nearly enslaved the [[Sword Coast]], and possibly the known world.

Ultimately, the Elder Brain/Netherbrain was destroyed in a climactic battle over [[Baldur's Gate]]. The Tav became a mind flayer in order to conquer the Netherbrain, using the Netherstones taken from the [[Crown of Karsus]].
