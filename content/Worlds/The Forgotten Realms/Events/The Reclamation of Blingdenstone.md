### Prelude to Battle

[[Kargien Dissengulp]] stood at the entrance to [[Blingdenstone]], his heart heavy with the weight of history. The echoes of past tragedy whispered through the ancient tunnels. Once a bustling city of deep gnomes, Blingdenstone had fallen into ruin, overrun by drow scavengers from House Duskryn as retribution for the Gnomes contribution to the [[Battle of Keeper's Dale]]

"*Brothers and sisters*," Kargien began, his voice firm yet carrying the gentleness of hope, "*100 years ago my Father and 12,000 Gnomes were forced from this land. Today, we do not just fight to reclaim stone and steel. We fight to reclaim our heritage, our pride, and our home!*"

His Burrow Wardens, elite in stealth and subterfuge, nodded in unison. Their faces, obscured by the shadows of their hoods, reflecting a silent determination they were comparatively few in number, but their resolve was unbreakable.

### The Silent Shadows

Kargien first dispatched scouts into the city who discovered the extent of the drow's hold. 

House Duskryn's forces, though spread thin, controlled the city's key strategic points, with their command scattered throughout the labyrinthine corridors. Among them, twenty-five **wererat deep gnomes** roamed, traitors by circumstance, adding to the complexity of the mission.

Kargien's plan was as audacious as it was fitting for the deep gnomes' talents. "*We will be their shadows*," he told his lieutenants, **Trisk Adamantelpiece** and **Miglin Crackedquartz**. "*We will move unseen, strike swiftly, and fade before they even know what hit them.*"

Under the cloak of darkness, the deep gnomes infiltrated the city's outer limits. Every step was measured, every breath silent. Kargien's warriors blended with the stone, their movements as fluid and natural as the shifting shadows of the Underdark.

### Guerrilla Warfare

The first blow came swiftly. A drow patrol led by a minor noble, **Austere Thatarn**, never saw his end approaching. Silent blades flashed in the dim light of the cavern, and within moments, the patrol lay lifeless. It was the beginning of a campaign that would see Blingdenstone's enemies terrorized and disoriented.

Kargien's strategy was to decapitate the leadership of the drow forces, creating chaos and mistrust among their ranks. Small, mobile units of deep gnomes carried out surgical strikes, eliminating key commanders and disrupting communications. Every assassination was executed with precision, and each retreat was covered by the natural concealment of the environment.

In one of the campaign's most pivotal moments, Kargien led a team to ambush a high-ranking officer of House Duskryn. As they approached the officer's quarters, Kargien whispered to his team, "*The burden of command must be exhausting for the poor sap.. let's put him to rest.*"

They struck like wraiths, and the officer was dead before he could hit the floor. His death sent ripples of panic through the drow ranks, their confidence eroded by the relentless, invisible enemy.

### The Turning Tide

The wererats, once deep gnome citizens, posed a unique challenge. Kargien, ever the strategist, sought to turn them against their drow masters. Through covert messages and promises of clemency, he began sowing seeds of dissent. It wasn’t long before the wererats started to question their allegiance, some turning on their drow master's further weakening the drow’s grip on the city.

As the days turned into weeks, the impact of Kargien’s tactics became undeniable. The drow's losses mounted, their resolve faltering under the weight of constant attrition. Each skirmish, each stealthy raid, chipped away at their strength and morale. House Duskryn's scavengers, once confident in their dominion, now lived in perpetual fear of the unseen menace that stalked them.

Kargien’s forces never engaged in open battle unless they had a decisive advantage. Hit-and-run tactics became the norm, each encounter meticulously planned to ensure maximum impact with minimal risk.

### A Light in the Darkness

The fight for Blingdenstone was far from over, but the tide had turned irrevocably. The drow, faced with the relentless assault on their leadership and the ever-growing insurrection among the wererats, were on the verge of collapse. Kargien knew it was only a matter of time before they abandoned their hold on the city.

In a rare moment of respite, Kargien addressed his warriors. "We have shown the strength of our spirits and the sharpness of our minds. Blingdenstone will be ours again, by the unyielding resilience of your hearts."

As he looked upon the faces of his comrades, Kargien felt pride swell inside himself as a joyful tear leapt down to the dark earth. 


The Wererats would be hell to deal with when the time came, but as always Kargien had a plan.

The city of Blingdenstone, with its ancient halls and storied past, would soon be free. And in its shadows, the deep gnomes would find their place once more.
