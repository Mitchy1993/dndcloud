In 1450 DR an army of aberrated humanoid's laid siege to the city of Waterdeep. The battle raged for an entire week with Waterdeep's military taking heavy losses and the Northern gates nearly being compromised.

The battle ended after the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] reached an uncharacteristically quick decision to form a special strike force, that came to be known as [[W.A.S.P]]. 

This small elite force was able to sneak behind enemy lines and nearly assinate the dark wizard controlling the assault.

The wizard dropped his spellbook in the ambush and fled. Without his guidance, the siege came to an end and the aberrated forces were quickly dispatched as they fell into disarray.
