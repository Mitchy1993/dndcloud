Arcanocytes are microscopic, magical organisms that exist within the cells of, nearly, all creatures. 

Arcanocytes play a significant role in determining an individual's innate magical abilities and are integral to understanding the disparities in magical aptitude among different races and individuals.

## Origins

It is theorized that when mortal's were first created, Mystra made sure that each new Type of non-deity creature was imbued with cellular organelles, which we now call "Arcanocytes," to facilitate biological interaction with the Weave.

## Characteristics

1. **Arcanocyte Density:** The density of Arcanocytes within an individual's body determines their potential for magic. Those with a higher density of Arcanocytes tend to exhibit greater magical aptitude.

2. **Arcanocyte Manifestation:** Arcanocytes manifest differently in various races and individuals, influencing their magical abilities. For example, elves may have Arcanocytes that resonate more strongly with nature magic, while humans may have a broader range of magical abilities.

3. **Arcanocyte Sensitivity:** Some individuals are more sensitive to the presence and influence of Arcanocytes, making them more attuned to magic from a young age. This sensitivity may explain why some individuals display magical talent without formal training, such as sorcerers.

4. **Arcanocyte Training:** While some individuals are born with a natural affinity for magic due to their Arcanocyte density, others may need to train extensively to harness their magical potential. Wizards, for example, may compensate for average Arcanocyte densities through rigorous study and practice.

## Exploitation

1. **Life-Draining Spells:** Spells that drain the life force of another person have often been described as siphoning Arcanocytes from the victim's body.  These spells essentially steal the magical potential stored within the Arcanocytes, leaving the victim weakened or dead.

2. **Arcanocyte Transfusion Viability:** The temporary effect of life-draining spells can be attributed to the fact that stolen Arcanocytes are not viable outside of their original host's body. Without the proper biological environment to sustain them, stolen energy or stolen Arcanocytes quickly degrade or become inert, leading to the temporary nature of the spell's effects.

## Conclusion

Arcanocytes are a fundamental aspect of the magical ecosystem in the universe, and are ubiquitously agreed to be the biological explanation for disparities in magical abilities among different races and individuals by most scientific & arcanic communities.
