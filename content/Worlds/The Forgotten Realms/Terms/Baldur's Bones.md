*The rules are as follows:*Â 

1. Each player puts the agreed ante in the pot.
2. Each player rolls 3d6. Play then proceeds clockwise around the table, with the host of the game going last.
3. On their turn, a player can choose to "stand" or "roll 1d6." If the player stands, the next player can take a turn. A player who rolls takes an additional die and rolls it. If the total of their dice exceeds 21, they "bust" and are out of the game. Otherwise, they can keep rolling additional dice until they either stand or break.
	1. Once a player "stands," they can no longer "roll"
4. After everyone has either "busted" or is "standing", the highest point total (excluding players who busted) wins the game and takes the pot.
