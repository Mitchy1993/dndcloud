# **Arcane Blitz**

## Setup
1. **Board Dimensions**: The playing field is 150 feet long and 50 feet wide, with end zones extending 10 feet at each end. The game starts at the 75-foot line (middle of the field).
2. **Teams**: Each team consists of an equal number of players, typically mirroring the party size against an equivalent number of enemies.
3. **Starting the Game**: 
   - Players can choose their "Conduit," or roll for who must be the "Conduit." All other team members are the "Currents."
   - The orb is placed in the center of the field. Each team sends one representative to make a contested Athletics/Acrobatics check. The winner gains possession of the orb.

## Objective
- **Winning**: A team wins by either:
  - Getting the orb into the opponent's end zone (like scoring a touchdown).
  - Ejecting all opponents from the game by reducing them to 0 HP.

# Sport Actions, Bonus Actions, and Reactions

## Actions

### Pass
Pass the ball from one teammate to another. A pass can travel a maximum distance of 30 feet. To make a pass, make a Dexterity-based attack plus proficiency. A pass is successful if the result of the roll is higher than 10.

**Example:**
- A pass for a level 6 character with a Dexterity score of 20:
  - `d20 + Dex Modifier (5) + Proficiency Bonus (3) = 7 + 5 + 3 = 15`
#### Led Pass 
- Pass the ball to a teammate with Disadvantage to also give Defenders disadvantage on interception checks.
- The teammate also has Disadvantage on their "Catch" check unless they lunge.

### Tackle
Tackle a creature to take the ball from them and push them 10 feet away. To tackle a creature, make a Strength (Athletics) check. The creature makes a contested Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If your check is higher than theirs, the tackle is successful, and the creature lets go of the ball. The ball now occupies the space the creature previously did, and the creature is pushed 10 feet away.

### Steal
Take the ball away from the grasp of a creature. To steal the ball from a creature, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The creature makes a contested Wisdom (Insight) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If your check is higher than theirs, you take the ball away from the creature.

### guard
A creature can take the "Guard" action to initiate a contested Intelligence check in order to follow that creature's movements and give them Disadvantage on "Catching" checks.

## Bonus Actions

### Pick Up
Pick up the ball when the ball is within 5 feet of you. This action can only be executed if the ball is not in possession of a creature.

## Reactions

### Intercept
Stop a pass or shot. If a ball not in possession of a creature enters your range as it is being passed or shot, you can use your reaction to try to intercept the ball. To do so, roll a Dexterity saving throw. If your roll is higher than the roll of the initial pass or shot, you successfully intercept the ball, and it is now in your possession.

### Lunge
Lunge in a direction of your choosing. You can invoke this reaction at any time except during your turn to move up to 10 feet in any direction. You can use this reaction to set yourself up for passes.

## Combat Rules
1. **Attacking and Spells**:
   - Standard combat rules apply for attacks and spellcasting.
   - Spells that require concentration or both hands to cast cannot be used if holding the orb.
2. **Ejection**:
   - Any creature reduced to 0 HP is ejected from the game and returned to their normal size outside the field.
   - They cannot return to the game once ejected.

## Concentration

If a creature receives any damage while in possession of the ball, they must immediately make a concentration saving throw, as if concentrating on a spell. On a failure, they let go of the ball. The ball now occupies an empty space of the GM’s choice within 5 feet of the creature.

## A Note
In order for these rules to work, class abilities or items that allow players to interact with objects as a bonus action or a free action should not work when dealing with the ball.

# Sports Tips

This section provides tips to play a match to its fullest potential. Share these before the match.

- **Casters** may wish to spend their time as defenders in the backline, close to the goalie, where they have the most range to influence the battlefield with their spells.
- **Ranged combatants** and characters with dexterity-based builds are better in the middle of the field to facilitate passes to attackers.
- **Characters with strength-based builds** are best as attackers, as the only way to gain points is to Shoot the ball into the enemy team’s goal.
- **Be careful** with using your reaction to hit a passing enemy with an opportunity attack, as you won’t have your reaction to intercept a ball if it comes near you or to lunge to receive a pass.
- **You can get someone to drop the ball** they are holding in several ways: You can tackle them, steal the ball from them, or damage them to make them lose concentration.


## Game Flow
1. **Starting the Game**:
   - Roll for initiative.
   - Two opposing players face off center field.
	   - The others stand behind them on *STAR*ting points.
   - The game begins with the contested Athletics/Acrobatics check for the initial possession.
2. **Playing the Game**:
   - Each turn, players and enemies can move, attack, cast spells, or take special actions related to the orb.
   - Play continues until one team scores by getting the orb into the opponent's end zone or all opposing players are ejected.
3. **Scoring and Winning**:
   - Reaching the opponent’s end zone with the orb scores a point and ends the game.
   - Alternatively, reducing all opponents to 0 HP also results in a win.

## Example Turn
1. **Initiative**: The party's rogue wins the initiative and starts first.
2. **Move**: The rogue moves 30 feet towards the orb.
3. **Pick Up**: The rogue uses their object interaction to pick up the orb.
4. **Action**: They decide to Dash to cover more ground, moving another 30 feet.
5. **Defense**: An enemy readies an action to guard the rogue, using their reaction to move and intercept any pass attempts.
