Creating a Chosen requires a God/Godess to sacrifice a massive amount of their total power profile, similar to creating an [[Avatar]]
- A portion of the power is vested into the Chosen, and the rest goes into holding by [[AO]]  
- In return they gain a massive amount of agency due to having a powerful mortal who can operate in all of the places Deities are no longer allowed to go.
- Mystra has a massive profile of power, *due to the nature of her domain,* and is able to field several times more Chosen than any other Deity.
  
**Death of a Chosen**
  - When a Chosen of Mystra dies, they become a [[Weaveghost]].
  - They serve Mystra in her domain

**Chosen's Nature:**
  - Not immortal, but age slowly.
  - Can inhabit their own body, an empty corpse or request that Mystra create a new body for them
  - Aged or destroyed bodies can be replaced while their essence remains part of the Weave.
	  - Deities cannot name a Chosen or replace a chosen's body more than once every 25 years
	  - After physical death, Chosen can sometimes continue to animate their corpse or animate another corpse at a very limited power capacity until a capable vessel can be created
