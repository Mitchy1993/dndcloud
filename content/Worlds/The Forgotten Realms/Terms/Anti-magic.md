An **anti-magic field** is a phenomenon that nullifies magical effects and suppresses spellcasting abilities within its radius. 

While the technical intricacies underlying anti-magic would require substantial arcanic comprehension, the following elucidation represents the prevailing layman's explanation.

### Weave Theory

The Weave operates on principles of resonance and harmonic frequencies that permeate reality, with spells and magical energies resonating within its structure.

### Magic Suppression Techniques
### 1. Weave Wave Disruption *(Most common)*

An anti-magic field emits a counter-resonance that disrupts the harmonic frequencies of the Weave within its radius. This creates a localized pocket of magical entropy where the orderly patterns of the Weave are fractured and chaotic.

This disruption manifests as a nullification effect, rendering spells inert and magical abilities impotent.

### 2. Arcanocyte Inhibition

Some artificed materials, such as "anti-magic cuffs," function by inhibiting the [[Arcanocytes]] in living creatures.

1. **Arcanocyte Targeting:**
   Cuff enchantments resonate with frequencies that are antagonistic to Arcanocytes, therefore disrupting the magical abilities of the wearer.
	- **Species Variation:**
		- Efficacy varies among species; creatures with unique magical biology may resist the cuffs' effects.
