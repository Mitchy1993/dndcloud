## Selecting the Temporary DM

### Roll for Initiative
Each player rolls a die (e.g., a d20) to determine who gets the highest roll. This adds an element of chance and excitement to the selection process.

### Group Discussion
The player with the highest roll discusses with the group who they think should be the temporary DM. They can choose any player or even the original DM, but they are encouraged to select someone who hasn’t DM'd before or shows interest in the role.

### Final Selection
The player with the highest roll makes the final decision. To encourage choosing a new DM, offer an incentive:
- **In-game Reward**: 
	- **Chooser:** Inspiration
	- **New DM:** [[Trophy of Narrative Flux]]

## Running the "Monster’s & Mayhem" Session
