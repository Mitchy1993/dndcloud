- Rovair acted at once, blasting the lord with magic missiles.
- The lord retaliated, and a portal opened with a horde of aberrated humanoids and skeleton archers pouring through.
- A tall aberrated spellcaster entered, along with his entourage, and sent out a shockwave that [[Spellbroken|Spellbroke]] everyone in a large radius.
- Rovair underwent a massive power surge, channeling the power to protect and save his companions + Vajra Safahr.

### Knowledge is Power
- By saving Vajra, the party discovered the goal of the enemies was to steal the [[Kiira N'Vaelahr]] from the tower.
- INCREDIBLY, Sando and Rovair surprised the dark caster and stole the gem from under his nose before escaping.
  - Sando took a brief nap after sustaining a 5th-level thunderwave to the face.
- Sando saved himself on a clutch NAT 20 baby! Freaking legend!

### Meanwhile
- The battle raged outside the tower with most of the city's defenders decimated.
  - However, the enemy forces also suffered severe losses.
  - The lord dropped as well.
  - Gruumshar unlocked the power of his ring and delivered an incredible burst of damage to the Rock Golem, staggering him backwards
  - Thrak the Nothic was killed            

### In the end...
- The pissed-off aberrated spellcaster appeared in the doorway of the tower and diverted all forces to the primary objective: *"capturing the gem, and killing all who get in the way."*
