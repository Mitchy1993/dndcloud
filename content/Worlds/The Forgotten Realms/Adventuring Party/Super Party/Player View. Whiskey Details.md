### Aura of Dread (1/LR) [3 Evil Minds]

- **Effect**: The Devourer exudes an aura that instills fear and unease in those around it. Creatures within a 30-foot radius must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + PROF + INT) or become frightened for 1 minute. Creatures that succeed on the save are immune to this effect for 24 hours.

### Adaptive Intuition (1/LR) [3 Neutral Minds]

- **Effect**: The Devourer’s insight into the minds it has consumed allows it to anticipate actions and reactions more accurately. It gains proficiency in two skills or tools of its choice for 24 hours, reflecting the knowledge and abilities of those neutral minds.

### Beacon of Virtue (1/LR) [3 Good Minds]

- **Effect**: The Devourer’s presence inspires those around it to act with greater courage and integrity. Allies within a 30-foot radius gain temporary hit points equal to half the Devourer’s level at the start of their turns.

## The Birth of an Intellect Devourer
Still dripping with creation, you are placed before the Elder Brain, the immense tendrils stirring in it's brine.

Next to the Elder Brain stands an Ulitharid, its tall form casting a long shadow across the chamber. Its eyes, deep and enigmatic, are fixed upon you with an intensity that pieces through the fog of your nascent consciousness.

"*This is the one I sensed*," the Ulitharid declares, its voice a resonant hum that seems to vibrate through the air and into your very cerebellum. There is a certainty in its tone, a conviction.

The Elder Brain’s attention, immense and overwhelming, turns fully upon you. It scrutinizes you, its thoughts probing your being with a depth that you don't comprehend. "*No... this can't be right*," its voice reverberating within the collective minds present.

"*The crawlers are not capable of it*."

The Ulitharid's gaze does not waver. It challenges the Brain "*You doubt my senses?*" a hint of indignation coloring its otherwise calm demeanor.

A palpable tension fills the chamber 

"*What I do not doubt*," its voice dripping with authority and quiet menace, "*is your paranoia. You are consumed by thoughts of the prophecy. You see its fulfillment in every shadow. I shelter you within my domain, allow you to feast upon the minds I cultivate, and yet you do not establish your own hive. Complacency is feeding your burgeoning psychosis*."

The words hang in the air, heavy and unyielding. The Ulitharid's eyes flare with sparks of defiance, but it remains silent, its mind a roiling sea of unspoken thoughts. 

You are caught in the midst of this exchange, barely grasping the weight of their words. But in the moment the pressure of their gaze upon you has softened.

***What do you do?***
