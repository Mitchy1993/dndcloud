# Session Notes: The Hazardous Hospital
![[Dr. Whiskey.png]]
***The way that AI interpretted your session^^^***
## TL;DR: The Hazardous Hospital

- **Body Bonanza**: The party rearranges bodies in the morgue, placing Schmeet and Tiberious in coffins and incinerating an extra body.
- **Disrupted Drop-off**: They plan to get an out-of-order sign but are interrupted by two [[C.L.E.R.I.C.]] constructs delivering a new body.
- **Fateful Finding**: Whiskey discovers the new body is missing its soul and notices similar energy traces from a previous check.
- **Seraphina's Clutch Crowbar & Nifty Nat 20**: Constructs notice Whiskey's findings, and Whiskey draws first blood/oil/etc. Seraphina and the gang barricade themselves inside the morgue and defeat the two constructs.
- **Deft Dive or Daring Disguise?**: Whiskey disguises himself as Safira to mislead the constructs, while the party prepares to escape through a window. Ubata falls during the escape attempt.

## The Long Version: The Hazardous Hospital
### Body Bonanza
The party stuffs Schmeet into the uppermost coffin, and Tiberious into the middle coffin. The party makes room for Tiberious by removing a body from an occupied coffin. Whiskey examines the body and is unable to find out anything remarkable about it. After the impromptu autopsy, the body is placed into the incinerator.

### The Disrupted Drop-off
The party plans to continue their investigation of the hospital, but now that they have altered the arrangement of bodies in the morgue they worry that someone coming to the morgue while they are away may discover their interference.

To resolve this issue the party decides to retrieve an out-of-order sign to prevent anyone from entering while they are away.

Seraphina realizes that this morgue is in daily use and someone could try to deliver another body soon. Just as she voices it, two [[C.L.E.R.I.C.]]'s approach and enter the room carrying a deceased patient. They sweep the room, and failing to find an open coffin they default to seeking out another morgue.
### The Fateful Finding
As the constructs turn to leave, Whiskey stops them. He identifies himself as a [[W.A.S.P]] Medical Doctor and conducts his own autopsy on the patient they are transporting.

His eyes glow with energy as he immerses himself in the arcane energies surrounding the body. Whiskey not only feels that some core part of this person that is required for life(*its soul*) is missing, and he notices the fading traces of the same mystical attunment from the **27 Arcana** check not more than an hour ago on a [[C.L.E.R.I.C.]] that was in standby mode.
### Seraphina's Clutch Crowbar & Nifty Nat 20
The constructs notice Whiskey's profound interest in the body and that a mystical discovery may have been made. They begin pinging a superior for assistance and direction.

Seraphina & the party try to divert, distract, and otherwise tie up the thought processes of the constructs, however before long Sable notices 4 more constructs enroute down the hospital corridor and let's the group know that they are about to have company.

Whiskey doesn't want to find out what the constructs have in store and attempts to gut the 2 constructs. The party springs into action after him. Serphina and Sable bar the door with a [[crowbar]], instructing Ubata to reinforce it with his body and Seraphina nearly single handley DEMOLISHES the constructs with an epic ***NAT 20*** whirling dagger attack and realizes that she is far stronger now than she's ever been.
### The Deft Dive Or The Daring Disguise?
Whiskey negotiates with the constructs, who activate an implanted sending stone to patch Safira through. Safira invites the special agents to her office for an explantion of this unfortunate misunderstanding. The party says no dice and opts to prepare to repel out of a nearby window, with Ubata losing his balance in a panic and landing with a thud while trying to clamber up to the window.

Whiskey stands his ground and disguises himself as Safira attempting to confudle the constructs in a daring all or nothing gambit.
