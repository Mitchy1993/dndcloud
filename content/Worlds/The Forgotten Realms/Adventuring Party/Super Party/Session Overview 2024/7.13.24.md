## Session Notes: Meet & Greet

### [[Seraphina.png|Seraphina]]
- Seraphina goes to meet the Elf she loves at Summer Court's festival. She weaves a beautiful dress for the occasion; made of spider silk and adorned in opulent fashion.
- Upon arriving she receives a mix of "ooh's"," awe's", and "I'm so over her" vibes
- Before long her anxiety builds as her love, [[Bramble.png|Bramble]] never shows
- She's given a lead on Bramble and chases him to a forbidden grove not far away where she speaks with ***[[7.13.24#3 interesting figures|3 interesting figures]]*** who are restrained from immediately destroying her by ***[[7.13.24#Someone more powerful|someone more powerful]]someone more powerful*** than themselves
- The scene ends with ***[[7.13.24#Many figures whispering|many figures whispering]] many figures whispering and surrounding*** Seraphina as the powerful woman approaches her.

### [[Tarethon.jpg|Tarethon]]
A Shadar-kai Elf arrives in [[Waterdeep]] with his trusty raven.
- As he conducts his business he hearkens on why he left his home in the [[Shadowfell]]
	- The night that his son, Roethe, was caught trying to escape the Shadowfell.
	- Tarethon relives the capture, his son being dragged away, and the ***Raven Queen*** blaming him for is son's defection.
	- Tarethon agrees to do what ever it takes to free his son.
		- The Queen offers him a single route to salvation for his son.
### [[Whiskey Gnome.jpg|Whiskey]]
- A plucky little psychic Svirfneblin Gnome who's yearnin' for some learnin' about brains, how they work, and what makes people who they are! 
- He's would love a group of friends to call his own, but till then he's happy focusing on doing a good hard days work, even though he's actually often smarter than his bosses.
- We watch this intrepid janitor ace his hospital interview with flying colors as he endears himself into Florence Nightingale's heart and our own. 
### Journey Start 
[[Sable.jpg|Sable]], Schmeet Schmichaelton, Tiberius Buddaah-blly, and [[Ubata.gif|Ubata]] receive their first mission as [[W.A.S.P]] members and head over to the [[House of Healing (Waterdeep)]] to investigate the rising mortality rate.

After a small kerfuffle with Seraphina crashing into the Material plane at Sable's feet, a debate breaks out over whether it's more weird to be immortal or to be a talking bird!?!

Arnold the hospital security guard nobly steps in to sort the situation, and is sure that he has done so, after Whiskey offers to take the small fairy to the Psych Ward.

### Doctor Who?
As Tarethon comes through the door, [[Dr. Lockwood.png|Dr. Lockwood]] recognizes that finally the investigation team he asked for has arrived and he brings all the "officers" into a side room for briefing:
- Whiskey follows along under the clever guise of.... doing his job *(honestly brilliant)*
	- The little rascal also nicks an official badge off of Tiberius who is shirtless and oblivious.
- Dr. Lockwood explains the mortality rate situation to the party and as Dr. Lockwood suggest that [[Davil Starsong]] might be to blame, Sable notices on a Nat 20 that she doesn't believe Davil has anything to do with it.
- Sable starts to shout orders at his squad, but Tiberius stands up to him, fed up with the blatant favoritism shown by Commander [[Erevan Lightshield]]. Tiberius prepares to mutiny and take the squad leading the investigation himself, but Sable ganks his trash and then intimidates the stinkies out of him. Ultimately, Sable allows Tiberius to take Schmichaelton, but demands that Ubata stays.
### Clever gir....Gnome
- After Dr. Lockwood leaves, Whiskey inspects a [[C.L.E.R.I.C.]] and on an ***INCREDIBLE*** juiced Arcana check data mines this bad boy discovering that:
	- These constructs are quite well made & hyper efficient at their medical roles, vastly outperforming mortal hands.
	- The constructs seem to be able to attune to creatures.
	- This attunement seems to be tied to a major core function of their design, but what exactly that core function is escapes Whiskey's understanding.
- With this information Whiskey seizes the moment for information and adventure flashing "his" new badge at Florence Nightingale while pressing her for information
	- She truly seems to know nothing about the deeper working's of the constructs, but confirms for Whiskey that the machines are stored with Safira Watts the Chief Artificer up in R&D on the 3rd floor.
	- Florence hopes the officers will put in a good word to her superiors after their investigation is completed.

### The Plot Get's Thicker Than Dom's Mom 
As the party embarks down the Hospital halls past sick patients, by the chapel, and through the surgical suite ***Seraphina's necklace***, that appeared on her neck when she arrived in this plane, ***began to pulse more fervently.***
- The party reaches a crossroad where either direction is the same distance from their destination.
- Significantly, they choose to take the path through the morgue
- While passing through they sniffs a mighty NAT 20 sniff.
- On this Nat 20 all possibility of them missing Sable's ex-coworkers is eliminated... They pull from the incinerators two poor charred bodies : one *Schmeet Schmichaelton* and *Tiberius Buddaah-blly*...
- $h!t hits the proverbial fan and Sable has a meltdown as he realizes that once again he is FAR FROM SAFE.
- The group devises a plan to hide the bodies until they can give them proper burials
- While the coalescing party has much left to discover, they know without a single doubt that anyone who thought the deaths in this hospital were due to natural causes were wrong... *dead* wrong.
