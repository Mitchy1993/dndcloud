### Schmeet All Over The Street
 ![[Schmeet in the Street.png|300]]
 ---
 
[[Whiskey.png|Whiskey]] surrenders to Safira with the understanding that Safira will let the other W.A.S.P. members live.

- Ubata climbs up to [[Sable.jpg|Sable]], [[Tarethon.jpg|Tarethon]], and [[Seraphina.png|Seraphina]].
	- When it becomes clear that the some are still considering a window escape, Safira discreetly dispatches her ground-floor C.L.E.R.I.C.s.
- Sable tosses Schmeet Schmichaelton's body out of a window 60 ft in the air, splattering his remains all over the cobblestone.
- Tarethon exits the window first in a dramatic dive bomb and whips around in mid-air to lightning lasso Sable and drag him down into a massive pile driver, but misses!
	- He blinks mid-air to cut his fall and crashes into the ground prone.
- Sable, distracted while preparing to climb down the rope, somehow doesn't notice or respond to a lasso made of lightning being thrown at him.
- Sable clambers down the rope and stands over Tarethon, not yet understanding that he was attacked on purpose, and begins to figure out how to get back to W.A.S.P. with the body.
	- They wait for Ubata to climb down as well.
	- As Tarethon, Sable, and Ubata collect themselves on the ground, 3 of the C.L.E.R.I.C.s round the corner, their eyes focusing on Schmeet's body. They begin to move towards him steadily, but not aggressively *yet*.
- Sable instructs Ubata to grab the body and get back to HQ!
		- With that, initiative is rolled, and the constructs dash to retrieve the body!
		- One construct tries to rip the shattered remains of Schmeet away from Ubata, but Shardmind strength prevails!
	- Sable leaps through a nearby food stall and begins sprinting back to HQ when an eldritch blast crashes into him from behind!
	- Turning around, he sees Tarethon with an Eldritch pistol still smoking.

### To Kill A Mockin-...Kenku?
To Sable's surprise, the pale elf he'd immediately trusted trudges toward him, saying the most psychopathic things, but in a tone that ***barely*** insinuates he is trying to be soothing or reassuring:
- *"Hey now, you don't have to make this difficult."*
- *"Listen, don't even worry, I'll knock you out first!"*
- *"You should have just let me **help** you down from the window."*

A drag-out beatdown duel ensues, with Sable transforming into a terrifying Were-Raven and Tarethon maneuvering around the battlefield, wearing down the Were-Raven using a Raven of his own.

### Take My Breath Away
- While Tarethon and Sable duel, Ubata flees from the constructs with Schmeet in his arms, but the situation is dire for him.
	- Ubata follows orders to the bitter end as blades puncture and pierce both of his lungs, killing him instantly.

---
Tarethon knocks out, stabilizes, and ties up Sable. As he drags Sable, he notices a nefarious-looking gnome sneaking into a nearby building.

### Will Work for Brains
Meanwhile, Whiskey and Seraphina strike a deal with Safira. Whiskey expresses his desire to join Safira's operation, and Seraphina assists by showing interest in Safira's motivations and establishing good relations with her.
- Safira steps away to contact a man, via magical zoom, who is wearing a nice suit and top hat.
	- Whiskey, with incredible perception, hears the password to activate the [[Crystal Conferencer]]
		- *"Nanther"*
- At some point during the fiasco, Whiskey sneaks over and steals a couple of data stones from Safira's workshop.
- Safira tasks Whiskey with delivering a Brown Briefcase to the mountains just north of Waterdeep.
	- ***(I couldn't find a Talespire object that looks like a briefcase, so in Talespire, it looks like a white box.)***
- ![[Brown Brief Case.png|250]]
- With that, Whiskey and Seraphina head out with a detachment of constructs tailing them, apparently to "guard" Whiskey.
	- Seraphina and Whiskey are allotted a moment of privacy in a hospital bathroom, where they view the data stones.
		- The messages are stolen logs from an artificer named [[Danactar]], creator of the [[C.L.E.R.I.C.]]s.
			- The bots had unintended capabilities and could transfer soul energy. The project was shut down due to potential abuse.
			- Safira Watts disappeared with the plans for the bots.

### Funny Meeting You Here
Whiskey and Seraphina lead their constructs downstairs, presumably to exit the city and head to the mountains. 
- *Frankly, I don't remember what they said their immediate goal was. They never told me whether they were going to deliver the case immediately or if they were going to inform the authorities first. I forgot to ask in the moment.*
	- *If the plan was to deliver the case immediately, then they actually took the most direct route out of the city, and that makes sense.* 
	- *Otherwise, I don't know why they would have gone the way they did.*
		- *There's a high chance it was meta-game shenanigans in an attempt to save Sable that I overlooked. My bad for not stopping that if so, but we can discuss.*

Sable is found unconscious and bound with Tarethon. Tarethon tries to explain that he's captured a monster, but Seraphina and Whiskey aren't buying it. 

### Tick, Tock, BOOM 
As the debate breaks out, the nefarious-looking gnome darts out of the nearby building in a full sprint!
- Whiskey reaches out to her telepathically, quickly offering his help, but receives no reply.
- Realizing that her silence is indicative of malicious intent, he threatens to track her down and insinuates violence.
	- She replies, "***Tick-Tock***"

---

- Yelling is heard from inside the nearby building, and people shout in fear! 
	- In the next critical seconds, Tarethon slaps Sable awake. The Kenku springs to his feet in panic and darts off in fear.
	- Tarethon goes to give chase, but Seraphina impedes his progress with Tasha's Hideous Laughter.
- Inside, a smokepowder chain reaction ignites, decimating the building in a massive explosion sending the party and two constructs flying!!

### The Aftermath
Sable is broken and fearful, Tarethon and Seraphina are injured but standing, and poor Whiskey lays in a pool of blood with a shattered skull... but suddenly, the skull bursts open, and from within...
- ![[Whiskey.png|250]]
	 - ***Actual Whiskey emerges***!!!

## Find Out Next Time

The group, and one C.L.E.R.I.C., regain their bearings on a city street in the wake of disaster. 
- In the midst of this chaos, how can the goals and needs of these individuals ever possibly align?
- Who is the man in the top hat on the [[Crystal Conferencer]]?
- What's in Whiskey's box/briefcase?
- Is Tarethon a psychopath?
- Ubata isn't dead, right?... ***right***?
