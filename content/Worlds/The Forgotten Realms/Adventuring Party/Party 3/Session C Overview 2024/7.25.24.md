## Session Notes
![[Undercroft collapsing.png]]
### [[Eldrin.jpg|Eldrin]]'s Entrance
- Eldrin confronts [[Alenia Jones]] demanding an update from his 3 new recruits.
- Alenia, with the appearance of Eldrin, now has physical evidence that Prathana and "[[Turak]]" are actually a part of something larger & not just two muggers trying to kill her in a dungeon.

### [[Prathana.gif|Prathana]]'s Promise
- Eldrin instructs the group on obtaining the [[Guardian Stone]]. This will deactivate the arcane wards guarding [[Blackstaff Tower]], and therefore [[Waterdeep]].
- Alenia protests for a moment, soley to ask how her concerns are going to be addressed.
	- Prathana quickly speaks up and offers to help Alenia steal her very own ship. 
		- *(Which was SICK btw)*
- Alenia set's her eyes on the task before her

### [[Dalinar.png|Dalinar]]'s Disguise
- Prathana demands that Dalinar to spill the bean's on his disguise, which he ***kind of*** does.
- Dalinar transforms into a 16 year old with piercing eyes. He tells Alenia that his name is actually Dalinar, but he allows her to believe that he WAS the Turak that she knows.
- [[Alenia Jones]] is shocked that he has been able to stay undercover working for these mysterious forces and will likely follow-up on that later, but for now she presses ahead into the dungeon to collect the [[Guardian Stone]].

### Unraveling the Undercroft
- Dalinar discovered a deadly mechanical trap and deactivated it.
---
- Alenia picked a lock that led to a room of potions
	- The room lashed out against anyone who could not interact properly with the arcane energy.
- Prathana and Dalinar obtained several potions and nearly unlocked the rooms full potential.
---
- Prathana, using Alenia's hairpin, unlocked a door where Dalinar was able to lift the lid off of a coffin, unleashing a friendly mage hand to accompany them through the dungeon
---
- With the help of the mage hand, Prathana and Dalinar swiftly navigated through skeleton's, treasures and bypassed trials to reach the final room

### The Parched Petrification's
- Dalinar investigated a hellish looking cabinet on the wall and on a ***NAT 20*** investigation check peered into ***[[Tav Exiting Avernus.png|Hell itself]]*** and glimpsed a horde of cambions demonic forces led by a powerful mind flayer marching into the material plane.
- Dalinar claimed both a *hellish* & *angelic* horse bit-and-bridle
- The pair solved the rooms puzzles and the horse statue turned into a neutral/tan horse.
### The Extreme Exit
- As the [[Guardian Stone]] was claimed, the Undercroft began to unravel and destroy itself from within. 
- The trio raced for the exit 
- Prathana threw Alenia on the back of the horse and galloped through the corridors
	- Dalinar was left to huff it out on foot, which could have been his end.
		- Dalinar would not allow himself to die while being so close to completing his ultimate goal.
			- He is finally within the inner circle of the Weave Eaters. He can finally unmask their plans and assess their threat level.


## Conclusion
Eldrin, sensing the collapse of the arcane protections on Waterdeep, [[dimension-door|Dimension Doored]] down into the Undercroft to receive the stone and officially dub his 3 new **Chosen**, granting them a permanent influx of power.
#### What comes next?
Will Dalinar & Prathana abandon the future of [[Waterdeep]] to a dark fate they've helped design?

or

Will they find a way to battle the looming forces only ***one*** day away.
