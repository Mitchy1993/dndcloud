#### Aelorin Nightfeather
- Came to Tavern looking for Helga
	- A pudgy woman approached him and Aelorin quickly deduced that this woman was shady and untrustworthy. Upon further questioning she folded and quickly retreated
	- Aelorin, assuming the woman to be an imposter, waited... and waited.... but the true contact never showed
	- Later that night Aelorin discovered that his true contact had been murdered! 
		- Aelorin nearly took the blame for it when he bumped smack into a party of adventurers investigating the murder
		- With some deft moves Aelorin resisted apprehension with a **NAT 20** 
	- A Harper named Helga had come to Waterdeep seeking to aid a local sanctuary that feeds children and less fortunate minority races
		- While waiting for Aelorin, Helga had been ruthlessly murdered and interrogated.
	- Authorities were called and the party plans to ***visit the sanctuary to investigate***
		
- **Dream:**
	- *Aelorin once again revisited the day that relentlessly haunts him*
		- *The day he was powerless to stop a young girl, Amelia, from being killed by a Mindflayer during the [[Attack on Baldur's Gate]]*
- Aelorin is now teaming up with this motley crew of adventurers, but not before he finishes 1st & 2nd breakfast & and ***ESPECIALLY*** not before he's had his coffee and *"[[bikkies]]"*
- After breakfast Aelorin learned of a rat infestation in the town, and traveled over to [[Waterdeep Stables]]
	- Potter & Petra informed him that they would pay him 50gp for proof that he'd found and eliminated the source of the rat problem
		- They'll also pay him 1 gp for every rat tail he brings them from killing rats in around the stables or in the city
	- As a Holy man they also offered him free borrowing of anything he needs while in town
- Aelorin returned to the [[Yawning Portal]] tavern to wait the last few minutes before the party sets off to ***[[Blackstaff Tower]] for a scheduled tour***
