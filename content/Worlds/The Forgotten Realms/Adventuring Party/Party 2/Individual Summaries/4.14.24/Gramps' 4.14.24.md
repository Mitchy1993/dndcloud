- Ole gramps made it home all on his own last night
- **Dream:** 
	- Gramps relived [[The Speech of Failure]]
- He spent the morning with Maggie catching up
- While passing by a crime scene, Gramps noticed that the man he had Eldritch blasted had succumbed to his wounds
	- Gramps had not intended to kill the man, but nonetheless the common man is entirely too brittle for spells meant to fell monsters
	- Knowing that his new friends would not take kindly to the murder, he ushered them back to their carriage and continued on their journey
- Gramps met Master Waygoo, an ancient Tortle, who was flabbergasted to meet someone older than himself. 
	- A good Master is first a great student and Waygoo soaked in the sage teachings of Elder Gramps sitting to meditate 
		- *"You called me a young'in, and then declared it wrong to call other's "young'ins" â€¦ I must mediate on the wisdom of this hypocrisy"*
