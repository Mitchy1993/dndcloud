## Rescue at Waterdeep Sanctuary

### The Tower
- Learned about the [[Battle Bell]] on the roof of Blackstaff Lobby.
- Arlo received a book titled "*The Comprehensive History of Netheril*."
  - *Now has advantage on ability checks when working on the prophecy.*

### Aelorin's Investigation
- The party met [[Loretta Stormsurge]] who told them that a benefactor was offering to move all of the inhabitants of the sanctuary to a new, more permanent home where all could live wonderful, safe lives.
- Aelorin spotted the fake "Helga" and confronted her.
  - After pushing her for answers, she folded once again and instructed her goons to "grab what kids they could and get to the boat!"
- A battle to save the children ensued with the party fighting tooth and nail while chasing down the kidnappers.
- Kiyano, aka *Doc Oc*, apprehended and restrained several kidnappers at once, freeing 3 children mostly on his own!
- "Helga" tried to escape, but in the end was only able to get close enough to the dock to yell a warning to the boat, which promptly shoved off the port.

### Have you accepted Ilmater into your heart?
- By means of a zone of truth spell, the party uncovered that "Helga" was, in fact, [[Madeus]].
- Madeus confessed to shipping minority races and orphaned children to work in facilities and mines owned by [[Melvaunt Incorporated]].
- After breaking Madeus's spirit and forcing him to admit truthfully that he loves no one and no one loves him, Aelorin read Madeus his last rites, per Ilmatari protocol, before ending his miserable life and casting him into the sea.
- On his person, the party found a [[bag-of-holding]] and an address.
- Kiyano helped a small child find her way back to the orphanage, and she lamented that she missed Mrs. Dekarios.
### Melvaunt Waterdeep Hub
- From the address, the party found the business base of operations for Melvaunt Incorporated in Waterdeep.
  - The place was an official place of business with no direct ties to anything nefarious.
- Gained info about nefarious activity connected to Melvaunt in the North Ward of Waterdeep and [[Daggerford]].
- Arlo discovered a [[Crystal Conferencer]].
  - Charmed a Melvaunt Worker into activating it.
    - Passcode to magic Zoom was '*arcaeus*'.
- Arlo impersonated Madeus and very nearly set up a meeting with a light-skinned human in a top-hat and a business suit, but blew his cover at the very end.
  - Turns out this was, in fact, the head chairman of the company.
  - The chairman shouted ominous threats and cut the line.
- Kiyano found the book that [[Master Waygoo]] was looking for.
  - It was in a foreign language that no one presently understood.
  - The cover had a Vitruvian Man.
