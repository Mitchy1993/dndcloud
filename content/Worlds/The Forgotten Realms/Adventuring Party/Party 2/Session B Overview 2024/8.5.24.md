![[Rat Tail Robbery.png]]
### Robbed at Tail Point
- The party ran the pockets of [[Potter Pettigrew]], who recklessly offered 50GP per rat tail to end the rat plague on his livestock.
	- The party received *Rascal's favorite sticky ball* and a *celestial looking bridle.* 
### Coffee and Lexapro
- Aelorin Nightfeather visited [[Isaiah Stormsurge]] and shared [Escitalopram](https://www.google.com/search?q=escitalopram&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS995US995&oq=escitalopram&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQABiABDINCAIQABiDARixAxiABDINCAMQABiDARixAxiABDIKCAQQABixAxiABDIHCAUQABiABDIHCAYQABiABDIHCAcQABiABDIHCAgQABiABDIKCAkQABixAxiABNIBCDM3NDRqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) together discussing the arcane wards that seem to be dissipating all over the city since [[Laeral Silverhand]] disappeared
	- [[Lords of Waterdeep]] have been dispatched with special forces to guard the remaining arcane anchors
- Isaiah confides in Aelorin that he needs people he can rely on now that [[Laeral Silverhand]] is gone and begs that when Aelorin receives his gifts from Mystra that he use those gifts to help Waterdeep get back on track
### Selene, Selune, and a Skeevy Jelly Man
- [[Kiyano Caelum.jpg|Kiyano]] & [[Arlo Gleamfoot.jpg|Arlo]] bump into [[Selene]] and asked her if she can help with the prophecy
	- She highlights that "*The Old Weave*" must refer to Mystra's Weave and after abysmally failing a History check is unable to expound upon the significance of that 
	- She offers that a cleric of Sel√ªne might know more. 
	- Selene was running late for a meeting with [[Vajra Safahr]]
		- Kiyano continues to Nat 1 conversations with everyone he meets without ever rolling a dice and Selene can't get away from him fast enough.
### The Birth of a [[projectors|Projector]]!
- Arlo turns his attention to the statue and distracts the guards creating an incredible display of magic pushing the boundaries of what minor illusion can do, while Kiyano stands in front of the statue with the prophecy in hand. 
	- Kiyano holds the prophecy front facing to the moon in frustration and his eye catches something hidden in the hood of the statue.
	- Arlo sends [[Blink the Owl.png|Blink]] to further investigate and together Blink and Kiyano activate the mechanism within the statue opening up a secret passage way.
- Arlo's illusion keeps the guards headed in the wrong direction for the moment, and Blink wakes up Aelorin right as he is about to fall asleep and they fly off in the night together.
- The pair meet up with the party just as the guards, Keris and Grathar, are returning from their wild gnome chase.
	- Aelorin says "*say hello to Thomas for me*"
		- To which the guards look at each other and go *"we hate Thomas.. kill that bird!!"*

### 18 Seconds
![[Breaking the Wards of Waterdeep.png|500]]
The party arrives in a dark stone corridor deep underground with brilliant blue light seeping through double doors at the end of the hall.
- Arlo lights a lantern and they proceed down the hall carefully
- Kiyano NAT 20 hears squeezes his sensors through the door and witnesses a ritual circle of some kind under the supervision of one of the Lord's of Waterdeep!
	- Piggybacking off of the NAT 20, Kiyano hears the lord say "Goooood, only *18 more seconds*"
- The party immediately kicks open the doors, surprising everyone inside and IT'S ON BABY!!
