## Description
A ***Karsite Event*** is a point in a timeline at which a massive burst of Karsite Weave is unleashed, unraveling *Mystra's Weave* and disrupting reality itself. 

### Aftermath
- Fluid realities are created that run concurrently
- Events, creatures, and entire landscapes can be warped and transformed
- The realities mirror each other in many ways, however these branches grow along wildly different paths
### Convergence
- Eventually, as reality seeks to restore it's true self, the "*timelines*" converge onto a rapidly forming "*Anchor Point*"

### Anchor Points
- A "*sacred*" reality is formed from all existing concurrent timelines
- Some events are cemented into the true reality & other's are pruned, surviving only in the memory of creatures who lived them.
- Histories are pruned and rewritten all at once as the "*sacred*" reality forms to be a final composite of all "*potential*" realities.
