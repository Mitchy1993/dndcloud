<small> Lost to the [[Spellplague]] <big>
**Chondath** was a country located in the [[Vilhon Reach]]. It had a long history. It was located on what once was the psiocracy of [Jhaamdath](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Jhaamdath "Jhaamdath") on the shore of the [Sea of Fallen Stars](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sea_of_Fallen_Stars "Sea of Fallen Stars"). Chondath was later a confederation of city-states under the capital of [Arrabar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Arrabar "Arrabar"), but used to be a powerful nation in times long past.

All of Chondath was ruled by [Eles Wianar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Eles_Wianar "Eles Wianar"), the Lord of Arrabar) He resided in the [Generon](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Generon "Generon"), a large palace located in the capital.

In [1386 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1386_DR "1386 DR"), as part of the Spellplague, most of Chondath was exchanged with parts of [[Abeir]] called [[Shyr]]. What remained of Chondath on [[Toril]] was utterly destroyed by the subsequent catastrophes of the [[Wailing Years]].
