##### There's a call to return to a time of greater chaos and freedom in the Fey Wild. 

- **Current State**: The Fey Wild is undergoing undesirable changes, due to the Dread Queen
- **Desire for Change**: The Queen wishes to save the Fey Wild and prevent its current state from recurring.
- **Offer**: She offers to send [[Cerberus]] to the Material Plane to save Enva, a part of the Fey Wild.
- **Conditions**: In exchange, he must perform two tasks:
  - Hunt powerful creatures as offerings to the spirit of the Wild Hunt.
  - Convert mortals to follow the ways of the Wild Hunt, increasing its influence.
- **Benefits**: Continuously making offerings strengthens the Fey Wild's connection to the mortal plane and may grant additional boons.
- **Ultimate Goal**: Restore the presence and spirit of the Wild Hunt on the Material Plane, allowing it to manifest fully once again.

This plan aims to bring back the chaotic and free-spirited nature of the Fey Wild
