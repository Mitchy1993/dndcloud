[[Feywild]]
*Stepping into the Feywild is like settling into a warm bath, though there is a chill doesn't fade from the air. It is a world of things that both are and are not & both being true at once is not impossible.* 

*For example, at first if an interloper such as yourself were to arrive your ears would perceive everything to be muted.... then you'd notice the roar of a river, the chirping of frogs and crickets, waves on a shore though you wouldn't know from where these sounds came for they occur whether these you are are near them or not*

*The sun is forever setting & never setting, an endless twilight of orange and fiery haze... it is for all intents & purposes perfect... this place we're trapped in is... pale and sickly in comparison.*

**Would apologize if he noticed he'd offended someone with his frank analysis***
