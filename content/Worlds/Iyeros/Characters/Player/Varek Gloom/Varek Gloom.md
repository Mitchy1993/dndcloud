Varek a 65 year-old [Verdan](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Verdan#:~:text=The%20verdan%20were%20originally%20a,mutating%20into%20a%20new%20race.) Paladin/Warlock who found himself at ground zero of the entropic power that burst into the Underdark from the entity known as "[That-Which-Endures](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/That-Which-Endures)"

The Verdan are a brand new race, as of the late 15th century, consisting of Goblins and Hobgoblins mutated by entropic energy. With no memory of their life before the mutation they fled the underdark in fear to find their lives on the surface.

Varek never settled down. Instead he trudged on from place to place with no meaning convinced that entropy is the only real truth of the world and that the best anyone can do is die. 

Varek is a man with no memory dropped in a world without context. His torment is a constant state of cognitive dissonance;  he does good to all he meets in a stoic effort to ***prove his own beliefs wrong***. *His words* are empty of all hope, in stark contrast to *his actions* which are often exemplary.
