- [[Titania]], the classic queen of faeries and joy and happiness (almost Tinkerbelle, but not so Disney)
- [[Queen of Air and Darkness]], dark and broody, considered unconventionally 'evil' by many
- [[Morwel]], the actual 'queen' & progenitor of the Eladrin, she's very literally bipolar
- [[Faerinaal]], probably only met him once or twice, really likes to mess with mortals, more of a classic 'trickster' Arch Fey
- [[Kyrriphuth]], the one you probably know the least about. He controls a domain in the Fey Wild known as *[[Shinaclestra]]* i believe
- [[Eireamhan]] you met, he was responsible for the first 'created' bridge between the Fey Wild and the mortal plane
- [[Meliodous]], progenitor of song
