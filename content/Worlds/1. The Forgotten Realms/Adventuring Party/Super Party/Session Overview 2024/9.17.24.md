### Underdark Breakfast Bunch
![[Underdark Breakfast.png|250]]
The group wakes up to the smell of Beholder Egg Omelets, Quaggoth Bacon with Duergar Stone Bread, and Fungal Pancakes with Cave Fisher Syrup. Tarethon kept watch all night with no events to report. Randy, the major domo, has been up for hours already, tending to early morning errands for his master, Lord Zond (now Whiskey), collecting egg recipes and such.

### [[The Daily Lute]] Morning News
![[Daily Lute Morning Report Uktar 2, 1502.mp3]]
The party listens to the morning news and discovers that Jaida has been apprehended for murdering [[Dr. Lockwood]] and bombing the [[Guild of Apothecaries & Physicians]] HQ. Florence Nightingale was not coerced onto the same roof as Dr. Lockwood, thanks to Whiskey's prudent warnings.

They also learn that after a funeral program for the lost citizens, Safira Watts will be honored for putting a stop to Jaida's rampage.

Whiskey instructs Tim, the Right & Left Hand of Zond, to play games all day.

### My Heart Will Go On
The group seeks to use Whiskey's new status to get free and easy healthcare. However, just before they reach the [[House of Healing (Waterdeep)]], Whiskey breaks off to make a quick but important public address at a funeral in the city plaza. His speech increases the party’s renown in Waterdeep to 10 as long as Whiskey remains with the party.

As Whiskey exits to the backstage, he bumps into Safira Watts, who is quite surprised to see him. The appearance of Unthril Zond seems to significantly affect her plans for the day, and she is flabbergasted to see him alive.

Whiskey sows some seeds of chaos in Safira’s mind, lightly questioning her about a "secret delivery" last night, to which she promptly lies, professing to know nothing of it. Whiskey twists the knife further by whispering the word "*Nanther*" to her, which elicits a barely restrained, writhing expression from Safira as she lies again and enters the stage to receive her honors.

Whiskey sneaks a glance over his shoulder and notices—on a high-DC perception check—that Safira presses a button on a magical device as she leaves her encounter with Zond.

Whiskey then psionically removes the remote from Safira with a Dirty 20 sleight-of-hand roll!

However, Safira rolls a NAT 20 on a perception check, realizing the remote has been taken. In a whirlwind of panic and rage, she whips out a sending stone and speaks into it: "*Warren! We have a problem. I need everything you can spare!!*"

### My Wand Gets Great Service Everywhere!
Meanwhile, inside the House of Healing, the rest of the party tries to barter and coerce the medical staff into giving them free treatment in an emergency room full of people.

Suddenly, Seraphina gets an idea! She uses *Minor Illusion* to turn her wand into an impromptu communication device and imitates Unthril Zond's voice, berating the medical staff and demanding treatment.

Ultimately, the dice repeatedly decide this plan is ludicrous. One medic is fired, and the House of Healing Cleric nearly helps a member of special forces until Sable cannot produce his badge.

The prolonged scene enrages the other sick patients, particularly one woman who had earlier called Sable a "Kenk." She outright lunges at Sable, claiming she personally knows people who would end him in an instant!

Seraphina promptly treats the woman’s mania with a dose of "crowbar" to the back of the head and instructs *everyone* to sit down.

All in attendance, including Arnold, take a seat.

### March of the Metal Soldiers
As the Emergency Room madness resolves forcibly, the chaos outside with Whiskey is just ramping up. The whirring of constructs moving at a fast pace becomes audible for all to hear... What comes next for our fledgling heroes? ***Find out next time!***
