## Session Notes: A Unique Angle on Volunteering for an Orphanage
![[Mol.png]]
### [[Guardians of the Dark Grove.png|Guardians of the Dark Grove]]
- Seraphina is pulled back into the Feywild, returning to the Dark Grove where her journey began. Here, she is greeted by Fey Elementals who inquire inquisitively about her absence.
    - They ask why she hasn't heeded "Amantha's" nudging to pursue "her boyfriend" [[Bramble.png|Bramble]].
    - Seraphina responds that she has her own interests on the Material Plane now and wants to see and learn more about the new people and places she's encountering.

- Lumina, the light guardian, overtly offers to ensure [[Amantha Brunswick.png|Amantha]] doesn't discover Seraphina's gallivanting.
    - Initially, Lumina requests Seraphina's full name in writing.
        - However, Seraphina, being the natural charmer she is, flits around from guardian to guardian, playfully tickling their egos.
        - In light of this, Lumina upgrades the offer to a partnership, where Seraphina agrees to collect and deliver a steady stream of *indulgences* in exchange for the guardians' discretion.

### This Town Ain't Big Enough for the Both of Us... But If It Was Bigger It'd Crash My Computer...
- Sable and Tarethon have a verbal showdown, and it becomes clear that Tarethon does NOT work for the [[Purification Society]]. Instead, he is collecting a bounty for the [[Blood Hunters]] who want Sable returned alive and healthy.

### Call Not Received
- Safira, via a [[C.L.E.R.I.C.]], checks in on the explosive development and finds her newest lackey, Whiskey, dead in the street.
- She laments for a moment before instructing the construct to return to her workshop with the [[Brown Brief Case.png|Brown Brief Case]].
- Whiskey tries to reach out to Safira about his current situation, knowing she has access to ample vessels for him, but is disheartened to realize the auditory and ocular receptors on the constructs are not equipped to receive psychic communications.

### Build-A-Body-Workshop
- ![[Explosion(Apothecary Guild).png|250]]
- Whiskey hears the convenient sound of dying humanoids and darts into a nearby building, currently engulfed in a raging blaze!
- Once inside, Whiskey reaches out psychically to all creatures within 30 feet and detects several still alive. Yearning for the immediate safety of a vessel, he blasts out the flames on a nearby dying victim and absorbs their brain matter. Once complete, he psionically ports himself inside the skull and assumes control of his new home.
- Whiskey also senses the youthful fear of a child in the room above him.

### For The Children
- ![[WASP Badge.png|250]]
- Whiskey returns to Sable and Tarethon in his new form and quickly convinces Sable that, while he is an intellect devourer, he also does in fact work for W.A.S.P.
- Seraphina is blown back into the Material Plane and lands at Sable's feet as Whiskey informs the motley crew that there are children inside, dying.
    - Side note: It is interesting that this intellect devourer... *feels* a compulsion to save them!?
- Seraphina bursts off, wings beating heroically, into the flames toward the upstairs location where Whiskey sensed the presence of a child.
- Sable looks at the fire and appropriately assesses the risk vs. reward for himself, deeming it a HARD NO.
    - Tarethon takes a chance on Sable, leaving him alone as he rushes after Whiskey and Seraphina into the fire.

### Holy MOL-y
- Seraphina reaches the second floor to find a young tiefling woman fighting the fire with a magical staff, but she is unable to make significant headway as she shouts, "*Peeta!*"
- Seraphina and the tiefling work together to save Peeta/Peter, with the child being flown down through an opening in the building while the tiefling throws herself from a second-story window.
    - She is caught by Sable outside, who breaks her fall with his own body, knocking himself unconscious.
    - The tiefling rolls a NAT 20 on her medicine check, reviving him, and flips him a [platinum](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/currency) coin before darting off to check on her orphans.

### 1, 2, 3 PUSH!!...Okay 1, 2, 3 PUSH & Burn All Spells/Abilities!!!
- Tarethon, Whiskey, and a young female tiefling give it EVERYTHING to ram a granite table into the superheated metal doors, creating an exit for the children and themselves.

### Altruism Is Its Own Reward!...Right?
- In the wake of their heroics, Sable signs autographs, making it known that he was part of the team who saved Waterdeep early last week.
- Whiskey "*preserved*" a locked chest from the burning orphanage containing a Potion of Speed, Truth, and [[Potion-of-Fortune|Fortune]]!
- Seraphina was gifted the [[Mourning Frost]] for saving the tiefling's orphans.
