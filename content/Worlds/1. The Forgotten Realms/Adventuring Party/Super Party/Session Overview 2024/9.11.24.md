# Session 6 Summary
The party regroups at the townhouse of [[Unthril Zond.png|Unthril Zond]], where they are greeted by Randy, Zond’s Deep Gnome butler. Over supper, they catch the latest news:

- Devastating explosion at the Guild of Apothecaries
- Denial of Ferocia’s nationhood. 
	- "*Striker Brothers*"

[[Whiskey.png|Whiskey]], still adjusting to his new form, tries to uncover Zond’s past and gain Randy's trust. During the conversation, Randy reveals Zond’s dark dealings, including trading preserved bodies to Mind Flayers for *life-extending* cerebrospinal fluid.

With honesty on the table, [[Sable.jpg|Sable]] opens up about his fear of the Purification Society, and explains his ties to the Blood Hunters. [[Tarethon.jpg|Tarethon]] briefly explains his need to gather souls for the [[Raven Queen]].

The party hatches a plan to help Sable sever ties with [[W.A.S.P]] and to destroy the [[Purification Society]]’s base, which aligns with Tarethon's soul-gathering and Whiskey's moral ambitions. However, danger strikes when a mysterious figure in a cowboy hat attempts to assassinate Sable. Though Whiskey shields most of the attack, Sable is severely wounded, and the group is left to face the stark reality of the threats they now face.

## Session 6 Notes: *Per Lord Zond of Course...*

### Enter Randy Cubblepot

After a long day of fire rescue and mayhem, Sable wakes up outside the townhouse of ***Unthril Zond*** *(whose body now belongs to Whiskey).* The door opens to reveal a small Deep Gnome butler who greets them with surprise at their tattered appearance.

Sable washes up in the outhouse, and the party is ushered inside by Randy, who asks them about their day and the reasons for their current conditions.

### Supper & [[The Daily Lute|The Evening News]]

![[Bonnie & Clyde.png|250]]

Randy puts on the usual evening news for "Unthril Zond," which discusses the following topics:

- Explosion at the [[Guild of Apothecaries & Physicians]]
  - Nearby orphans displaced
  - Investigation ongoing; Bonnie Bones is obtaining an interview with House of Healing staff for a scoop tonight
- In the Far East, Ferocia is denied recognition as a nation, again.
  - Gnoll attacks reported, although the leader of Ferocia denies involvement.
  - No injuries reported, thanks to intervention by the famous ***Striker Brothers!***

### Am I a Good Man?

Whiskey tries to uncover what kind of man Unthril Zond was before Whiskey took over his body.

- Randy will not say that Unthril is a bad man, but when questioned, he insinuates that Zond is not morally good.
- Whiskey tells Randy that his near-death experience has "*changed*" him and that he is turning over a new leaf, starting with his business dealings. Whiskey tries to butter Randy up with respectful honorifics.
  - Whiskey instructs Randy to speak openly about his business affairs with his new guests. However, Randy is hesitant to comply and suggests they discuss the matters privately in Zond's study after supper.

### Post-Supper Reveal!!
![[Whiskey.png|250]]

Against Randy's advice, Whiskey wants to include the party and his right-hand man "*Tim*," inviting everyone into his "***Inner Circle.***"

- Whiskey unmasks himself to reveal that he is an intellect devourer!
  - Randy falls over backward as he produces a cane and swings wildly in defense, shouting an incoherent jumble of frightened exclamations, most of which revolve around the whereabouts of a silver circlet.
- Whiskey successfully calms Randy down through calm reassurance of his benevolent nature, expressing the respect he has for Randy and the desire for friendship.
  - While Whiskey is attempting to explain his nature as an intellect devourer and his recent morgue operations at the House of Healing, it comes out that Unthril Zond had been regularly having bodies perfectly preserved at the time of death to maintain the integrity of their brains, selling them to Mind Flayers in exchange for cerebrospinal fluid to extend his own life.

### Getting to Know Sable & Tarethon

As Whiskey has now opened up "honesty hour" for the group, Sable pours out the history and truth about his past life of fear and hiding due to the [[Purification Society]].

- Kenku and some other races are hunted after adulthood. Sable doesn't understand why; it's simply a fact of life for him.
- Sable had a near-death encounter with the Society last week, but he was able to outwit them.
- As Sable was approaching the adult age for a Kenku (12), he joined a cult/society/organization called the [[Blood Hunters]]. The power they offered him has significantly increased his survival odds, but Sable has recently realized that his current arrangement with them requires stricter check-ins than he'd understood, greatly restricting his freedom.
- Sable remembers he can contact [[Lyra Dawnfury]] through his magical ring and explains his predicament honestly and openly with her.
  - His story is true, but unfortunately, Lyra is not in the mood to buy a sob story at the moment. Instead of outright forgiveness, she offers an ultimatum:
    - Return to base within 15 days, or Lyra will increase his bounty level.

Tarethon briefly explains his straightforward interests on this plane, needing to collect a certain number of souls for the [[Raven Queen]] and how, at his current rate, he has a long way to go.

### Hatching a Plan

With everyone's interests on the table, aside from the unconscious Seraphina, the party realizes that their goals are more aligned than they had previously imagined. Their new plan is simple:

- Formally resign Sable from [[W.A.S.P]].
- Locate the disgruntled employee, Jaida Scorned, who blew up the Guild, and learn how to level a building like she did.
  - Locate the [[Purification Society]] base in Waterdeep's North Ward and blow it to kingdom come.
    - This would satisfy a **significant** number of souls for Tarethon's interests, do good in the world for Whiskey, and, best of all, mark the first time in history that a Kenku dealt any kind of significant blow to the Society.

### Curiosity Killed the Kenku

![[Paddyroller.jpeg|500]]

As good spirits and camaraderie wash over the newly formed team, Sable feels chills in his spine as his Kenku senses tingle. He notices a silhouette wearing a cowboy hat in the shadowy streets below the window...

- Sable loses sight of the figure in the dark streets below. Trying to keep track of them, Sable says he's just seen someone outside and sticks his head out of the window to locate the shadow he thought he'd seen.
- Tarethon and Whiskey realize the danger immediately. Whiskey springs into action, diving to tackle Sable away from the window... but it's too late.
- A southern voice shouts from outside, "*Die, you Kenk!!*" as Blunderbuss shotgun pellets shatter the 2nd-floor window!
  - Whiskey throws up a telekinetic shield, but a single pellet still gets through and disfigures Sable!
  - Boots can be heard running on the cobblestone below, heading in a south-western direction.
- Whiskey and Tarethon drag Sable away from the window and stop the bleeding to save his life, but in a single sobering moment, the dangers this newly christened band of adventurers face are suddenly all too real.
