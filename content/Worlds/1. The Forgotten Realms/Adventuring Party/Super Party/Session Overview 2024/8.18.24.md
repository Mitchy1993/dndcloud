![[Bag of Beans.png]]
### Peeta & the Secret Circlet
![[Circlet of Intellect Guarding.png|250]]
- [[Sable.jpg|Sable]] and [[Tarethon.jpg|Tarethon]] notice that, while seemingly comforting Peeta, [[Mol.png|Mol]] swiftly deposits a Silver Circlet into her coat that she receives from Peeta.
  - The two of them whisper about what it might be and key in [[Seraphina.png|Seraphina]], who thinks it is suspicious that Mol is specifically looking for that boy while there are so many other children in danger.
- Seraphina asks out Mol, who uncomfortably declines the advances from the small female fairy.
  - However, after some persuasion rolls from the party, Mol is successfully convinced to come out for drinks with them.

### The Rise of Ambitious Tim!
- Whiskey finishes collecting his effects from his old vessel and returns to Tim, who is happy to see his boss, Unthril Zond, still alive.
- Tim updates Unthril on an ongoing investigation into a spike in hospital-acquired infections.
  - Apparently, someone is trying to make people sick with infections that arenâ€™t life-threatening, but would cost the hospital a ton of money due to the infections being acquired there.
  - Whiskey recalls a Gnome that seems to have it out for his Guild and tells Tim to narrow his search to Gnomes who have a vendetta against the organization.
    - Tim rolls a great history check and recalls "Jaida Scorned," a deep gnome who was fired when Safira was hired.
      - Whiskey recalls the firing faintly but does remember Jaida pleading about her mother or something like that.
- Whiskey decides to expand Tim's usefulness and first instructs him to retrieve any valuable assets in the burning guild building to *test* Tim's loyalty.
  - Tim passes with flying colors.
- Next, Whiskey instructs Tim to retrieve brand-new armor and a fine sword from the nearby forge "Steel & Steam."
  - Tim is given a potion of fortune, the promise of power and position, and 10 minutes to return.

### Great Guy
- The party arrives at [[Selune's Smile]], where they get drinks, leaving Peeta downstairs with Matey the Bard,.
- Sable tells tales of his adventures and triumphs from the week prior.
	- A couple of guests and Mol herself are quite impressed with his accomplishments.
- Whiskey arrives with new +1 armaments and an unconscious Tim over his shoulder.
- Guy, an enthusiastic party patron, says he's SO ready to party and runs downstairs to get more drinks for everyone!

### The Uncrackable Case
![[The Uncrackable Case.png|250]]
- The group hears some people on the roof trying to open an uncrackable case and tries their hand at it.
- Whiskey investigates the lock and finds no magic but realizes the lock has been tampered with and rigged to not open without a complex maneuver that first removes debris from the mechanism.
  - He relays this to Sable, who on an incredibly well-timed NAT 20 pulls off the maneuver and is able to crack the case on his FIRST try!
- Sable collects the items quickly before they can be stolen by overeager onlookers and obtains a [[bag-of-beans]], an [[immovable-rod]], and an [[eversmoking-bottle]].
- Mol is so impressed with Sable for the 3rd and final time this day!
	- Sable saved her life, turns out to be the hero of Waterdeep, and broke that impossible lock with ease.
	- Mol offers Sable a chance to come with her tomorrow night to deliver the Silver Circlet to a contact from her past who has  recently returned.
	- Sable plays dumb until Mol just finally shoots her shot and tells him that she doesn't ever ask people out but this seemed like an activity that he would like and would open up opportunities for him.
- Sable flat out *rejects* her offer and then as she gets ready to leave he tries to reach into the coat she's currently wearing to steal from her and she slaps him across the face exclaiming "*if you ever try anything like that again I'll kill you*!" and then she runs off and grabs Peeta on the way out.

### Sad Guy
- Seraphina passes out from overdrinking, the party gets ready to leave with their spoils, and Guy returns to find the excitement has all occurred without him. He sadly sets the drinks down and heads back downstairs to sulk.

### Big Bad Beans & Equivocal Eggs
![[Magic Eggs.png|250]]
- The party plants 1 out of 11 beans outside the tavern to see what happens, and after 1 minute, 7 eggs sprout up from the ground!
- Whiskey eats 1 and nearly explodes but instead becomes more charismatic.
- The whole party joins in consuming ALL of the eggs in one sitting:
  - Whiskey succeeds in all checks.
  - Tarethon tricks the sulking Guy into thinking that he wants to party with him and tells Guy to attempt a backflip at the same moment that they consume all of the eggs.
    - Guy is filled with renewed excitement and obliges, believing it to be some kind of party game!
    - As Guy performs the sickest backflip Waterdeep has ever seen, Tarethon magically trips him in mid-air to give himself ADV on the egg-eating contest. Guy rerolls a 3, landing with a thud and a crack on his neck, lying crumpled in the street.
  - Unfortunately, Seraphina and Sable cannot pull off the DC 20 CON save and suffer an internal explosion, absolutely decimating their insides with a magical blast.
    - Sable's explosion is contained to his leg, which fractures.
    - Seraphina suffers body-wide internal magical burns.

### A Long Day
- With 2 members unconscious and the evening turning into nightfall, the party decides that they must rest, and Whiskey invites them back to Unthril's home.
- As the party heads for rest, Whiskey hears the faint sound of a man yelling but can't quite place where it's coming from.
