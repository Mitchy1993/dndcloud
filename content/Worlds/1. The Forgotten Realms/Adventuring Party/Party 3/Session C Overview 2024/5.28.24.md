## Session Notes
### Shark Attack 
- Prathana rolled a _**Nat 1**_ while trying to swim stealthily
    - She subsequently choked on sea water and began thrashing
    - This attracted a [[hunter-shark]], which bit into Prathana’s hip
    - The shark was then non-ceremoniously “ripped apart” by daggers, energy blasts, and a subsequent [[killer-whale]] attack ![[Prathana Shark Attack.png|500]]


### Passing Time 
- Prathana and Dalinar did not investigate [[The Gemfire]] below deck, but did find a map in [[Alenia Jones]] quarters that had Chultan inscriptions and an X marked a spot on the small continent of [[Chult]]

### Clearing the Way

- Prathana tricked [Grathar] into believing that his wife, Nessa, was injured in the “Pirate Attack” on [[Evernight]]
- She then convinced [Keris] that he should take his rightful place in the investigation team with [[Detective Trevius]]
- Once the guards were gone, used fire to open the [[Statue of Lords of Waterdeep.png|Statue]]
    
    - She quickly proceeded inside to lay in wait for what she believed to be a capture/kill mission
        - <small>In order to gain leverage over, or intimidate [[Tommy Jones]].<big>
        
    

### Change of Plans

- Prathana was in a position to strike, when Dalinar interjected and wanted to change plans
    - He conjectured that he could woo Alenia to their side, and get her to join the WeaveEater’s willingly.
- The pair tried to convince Alenia to see reason and join them.
- Alenia, unhappy with being deceived and, suspecting that someone might be impersonating her pet [[Turak]], was initially very resistant to trusting them
- However, after some prodding and leaning into her curiosity about the resources and freedom the _**WeaveEater’s**_ could provide her, she eased up a bit and demanded any kind of proof that there was something more to this than a simple kidnapping or murder attempt.

### The Uno Reverse Card of All Reverse Cards

- Dalinar signaled to Prathana that it was the time to activate her spell brand and summon Eldrin
    - To show Alenia that he was not lying
- _**BUT**_ against all freaking odds, on a _1/400 chance,_ _**DOUBLE NAT 1**_ Prathana could not figure out how to activate her spell brand, which stalled long enough to cause Alenia to conclude this whole thing was a dangerous trap
- Alenia flees!

### The Arrival

- After a being struck with a [[Hunger of Hadar|Hunger of Hadar]] figured out how to activate her spell brand
- Eldrin arrived in a burst of blue spellfire
    - Concluding that the blood-stained female was not exactly the “willing” recruit he was promised, Eldrin [[dimension-door|Dimension Door]]’d down the hallway to assess Alenia’s usefulness for himself  ![[Eldrin & Alenia.png|500]]
