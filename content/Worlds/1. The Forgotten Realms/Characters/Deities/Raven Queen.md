# Summary
**The Raven Queen** was once **Elyndra**, a radiant fey queen of peace and harmony. Her attempt to mediate the elven conflict between **Corellon** and **Lolth** led to her betrayal by Lolth during the **Spellplague**. Elyndra's failed ascension transformed her and her followers into shadowy beings tied to the **Shadowfell**, becoming the **Raven Queen**. Now, she loosley governs **memory, fate, dread, and darkness** from her home, the **Palace of Memories**, embodying a tragic shift from a queen of doves to a goddess of ravens and darkness.

Her most loyal servant's are the [[Corvid Conclave]]

## Early Life and Role in the Feywild

### Queen of the Silverlight Eladrin

Before her transformation into the Raven Queen, Elyndra was the queen of a group of Eladrin known as the **Silverlight Eladrin**, who were part of the **Seelie Court**. She was known for her association with **light, peace, and harmony** and was a prominent figure within the Feywild, beloved by her people for her wisdom and gentle nature.

Her domain, known as **Illyndor** was perpetual "dawn." contrasting the normal perpetual twilight of the [[Feywild]].
- in Illyndor, mass flocks of **doves** flew freely, and Elyndra herself was referrred to as the Dove Queen.

### Ending the Corellon-Lloth Feud

Elyndra’s greatest ambition was to end the ancient feud between the elven deities **Corellon Larethian** and **Lolth**. This conflict had fractured the elven race and caused lasting turmoil across the **Feywild** and the **Material Plane**. Elyndra believed that by ascending to godhood, she could **mediate the conflict** between these powerful deities and bring about lasting peace, healing the rift among the elves and restoring harmony across the planes.

## The Ascension Attempt

### The Spellplague and the Ritual

In 1385 DR, during the chaos of the **Spellplague**, Elyndra saw an opportunity to harness the **instability of magic** to ascend to godhood. With the help of her most loyal **Silverlight Eladrin**, she began a powerful ritual that would elevate her to divine status, granting her the power to bring an end to the **Lolth-Corellon feud**.

Elyndra’s ritual was designed to make her a **goddess of peace and harmony**, so she could mediate between the two warring deities and unite the elven people once again. Her motivations were purely noble, driven by a deep desire to protect her people and create lasting peace.

### Disruption by Lolth

However, Elyndra’s plans were disrupted by **Lolth**, the chaotic and treacherous goddess of the **drow**. Fearing that Elyndra’s ascension would weaken her influence over the drow and threaten her chaotic power, Lolth sent disguised drow to infiltrate the ritual, causing it to backfire.

Instead of ascending into the light, Elyndra and her court were **cast into the Plane of Shadow**, a realm of darkness and melancholy. The ritual’s failure corrupted the magic, transforming Elyndra’s radiant nature into something dark and twisted. 

## Fall into the Shadowfell

### Transformation into the Raven Queen

Elyndra’s descent into the **Plane of Shadow** changed her forever. The radiant dove-queen was twisted by the magic of the plane, transforming her into a figure of **shadow and memory**. Her **doves**, once symbols of peace and hope, were warped into **ravens**, omens of death and fate. She became known as the **Raven Queen**, and her connection to light was lost forever.

Her court of **Silverlight Eladrin** were also transformed, becoming the **Shadar-kai**, shadowy beings forever bound to the Shadowfell and the Raven Queen. 

The **Plane of Shadow** itself was altered by the [[Spellplague]] & the Raven Queen's arrival, tearing a permanent hole in the plane that connected it to the [[Feywild]].  That portal became the "**Dark Grove**".

 Elyndra's descent into the Plane of Shaow happened during the exact moment the Plane of Shadow became the **Shadowfell*.
 - Historian's are unsure as to whether this was a coincidence or a direct result of the Raven Queen's arrival during the [[Spellplague]].

### Domains

Now a minor deity, the Raven Queen dwells in the ***Palace of Memories***, where she governs her **Shadar-kai** and her semi-domains of **memory, fate, and dread**. 

#### Shadar-kai

The Raven Queen’s strongest domain is the souls of her **Shadar-kai**. All of them are bound to her and their souls return to her when they die to be reborn at her leisure.

#### Memories, Fate, Dread
**Memories** 
- She collects and safeguards as many memories of the living & dead that she can obtain, particularly those that would otherwise be forgotten. Some mortals pray to her to preserve their legacies beyond death, hoping that she will remember them even if the world forgets.
- She also holds some power over the **fate** of mortals, particularly over those consumed by dread.
- Dread & Darkness are an alternative source of power for the Raven Queen.

## Legacy 

### The Dove Who Became A Raven

- The tragic contrast in the Raven Queen’s story is her transformation from a **queen of doves** to a **queen of ravens**. 
- Once a figure dedicated to **peace** and **harmony**, Elyndra’s fall into the Shadowfell turned her into a goddess of **shadow, memory, and death**. Her ambition to **end the ancient elven conflict** was noble, but her failure led to her **eternal transformation**.

In her heart, the Raven Queen still holds a faint glimmer of her original purpose, but she is now a **cold and distant deity**, her hopes for **peace** overshadowed by the inevitability of **death and fate**.
