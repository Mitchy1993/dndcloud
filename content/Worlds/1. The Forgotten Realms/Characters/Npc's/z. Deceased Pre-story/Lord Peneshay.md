#### **Overview**  
Lord Peneshay is a renowned dwarf knight and former leader of the **Order of Tye**.

#### **Leadership**  
From 1372 DR until his retirement in the late 15th century, Peneshay expanded the Order’s role from escorting dignitaries to safeguarding Waterdeep’s naval forces.

#### **Rescue & Mentorship**  
In 1495 DR, Peneshay was saved by Triton **Admirius Ackbar** during a pirate ambush. Recognizing Ackbar's potential, Peneshay mentored him, eventually passing leadership to him in 1485 DR.

#### **Legacy**  
Though retired, Peneshay remains an influential figure and is rumored to still advise Ackbar in secret.
