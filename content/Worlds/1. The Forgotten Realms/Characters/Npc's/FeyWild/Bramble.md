### Bramble's Quest
- Approached by [[Amantha]] before he could propose to Seraphina.
- Frowned upon his meager flower necklace and a handmade ring carved from wood of an ancient oak.
- Asked if he truly loved Seraphina, how can one know for sure unless that love has been tested?
    - No bond can be stronger than one made with the Ring of Eternal Love.
- She gave you two instructions:
    - kill [[Grizz Glastow]] at [[House of Healing (Waterdeep)]], his accomplishments in [[Waterdeep]] send the wrong message to Goblin kind if he is allowed to rally others.
    - obtain [[The Goblin King's Crown]]
- In return, the [[Ring of Eternal Love]] will be his.


### Bramble's Letter
My Dearest Rina,

I pen this letter with a heart full of love and longing, hoping it will find it's way to you. First and foremost, I am deeply sorry for not meeting you tonight as we had planned. Although I would rather die than break a promise to you, tonight it seems I'm forced to break a promise for you.

Tonight, an unexpected opportunity arose. It can bring something truly extraordinary into our lives, something worthy of the love we share. The journey I must embark upon required me to leave immediately, without a chance to explain in person. This pains me deeply, but please know that every step I take, every breath I draw, is filled with thoughts of you. 

From the moment we met as children, playing under the ancient oaks and dancing with fireflies, you have been my light, my guide, and my greatest joy. Every moment shared with you has been a treasure. You are my Rina, my heart, and my soul.

I ask for your patience and trust in this time of absence. Hold onto the love we have nurtured, and let it be your strength as it is mine. I promise you, my love, I will return as soon as I can, with something that truly reflects the depth of my feelings for you.

Please wait for me and do not chase after me. Wait in our beautiful Feywild my beloved Seraphina, and remember that you are always in my heart, my thoughts, and my dreams. I am doing this for us, for the future we will build together.

*With all my love, forever and always,*
***Bramble***
