- Among the [[Raven Queen]]'s most trusted servants are the Corvid Conclave, a group of 3 powerful entities. They report to her with information from across the planes.
- Each member of the conclave is bound to a specific domain the Raven Queen wishes to control: Death, Memories, Fate.
	- One of their jobs is guarding  "*The Dark Grove*" which is a passage between the [[Feywild]] and the [[Shadowfell]] which can be activated by those with arcane proficiency to pass easily into the [[Shadowfell]]
		- *The Grove* is the transformed remains of the original calamitous site for the Raven Queens "*Ascension*," which ironically was her downfall to the Shadowfell. 
- They are also members of what is known as the [[Guardians of the Dark Grove]]
