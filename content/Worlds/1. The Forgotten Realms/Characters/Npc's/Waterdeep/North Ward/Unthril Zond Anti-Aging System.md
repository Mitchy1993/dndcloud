### Missed Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) Supply System

Unthril Zond must take a dose of cerebral spinal fluid every **3 days** to prevent rapid aging. If he misses his dose, he experiences a swift decline as his body starts to age dramatically. The effects build over time, becoming more severe the longer he goes without the fluid.

#### **Stage 1: Early Aging (Day 4-6)**
- **Physical Weakening**: Unthril begins to show signs of rapid aging—wrinkles deepen, and his muscles weaken.
  - **Constitution Check**: DC 13 at the end of each day. On failure, Unthril suffers **1 level of exhaustion**.
  - **-1 Penalty to Dexterity**: His agility starts to fade, affecting Dexterity-based skills and saving throws.
  - **Reduced Stamina**: Unthril suffers **disadvantage on Dexterity-based ability checks** (e.g., Acrobatics, Stealth).

#### **Stage 2: Accelerated Aging (Day 7-9)**
- **Rapid Decay**: His body deteriorates quickly, visibly aging decades in just a few days.
  - **Constitution Check**: DC 15 at the end of each day. On failure, Unthril gains another **1 level of exhaustion**.
  - **-1 Penalty to Strength and Constitution**: His strength and vitality wane, reducing his physical power and fortitude (affecting Strength and Constitution saving throws, skills, hit points, and melee attacks).
  - **Speed Reduction**: His movement speed is reduced by **10 feet** as his body slows down.

#### **Stage 3: Severe Aging (Day 10-12)**
- **Near Collapse**: Unthril’s body is on the verge of total failure.
  - **Constitution Check**: DC 17 at the end of each day. On failure, Unthril gains another **1 level of exhaustion**.
  - **-2 Penalty to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution**: Unthril’s physical capabilities continue to degrade, making even basic movements difficult.
  - **Disadvantage on Attack Rolls and Saving Throws**: His body is so frail that he struggles to fight or resist harmful effects.
  - **Disadvantage on All Physical Ability Checks**: Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution-based checks are all at disadvantage.

#### **Stage 4: Critical Aging (Day 13+)**
- **Imminent Death**: Unthril’s body is failing entirely, and he is close to death.
  - **Constitution Check**: DC 18. On failure, Unthril suffers another **1 level of exhaustion**.
  - **Death at Exhaustion Level 6**: If Unthril reaches exhaustion level 6, he dies from his body’s complete collapse.
  - **Severe Debilitation**: Unthril is unable to take actions that require significant physical effort and can only move at half his reduced speed.

#### **Replenishing the Supply**
If Unthril receives his dose of cerebral spinal fluid:
- He immediately loses **all levels of exhaustion**.
- **Restores Ability Scores**: His Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution return to their normal values.
- **Cumulative Aging**: Although his functionality is restored, Unthril may retain some visible signs of aging (e.g., wrinkles, stiffness in movement), depending on the DM's discretion.

### Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) Supply for Unthril Zond

#### 1. On His Person
- **1–2 doses** (enough for 3–6 days):
  - Unthril carries a small amount of CSF for emergencies. This gives him enough time to return home or make new arrangements if his supply runs low.
  - He likely stores these vials in a secure pouch or container, keeping them hidden and protected.

#### 2. Pick-Up per Venture into the Underdark
- **20–30 doses** (enough for 60–90 days):
  - On each trip to the Underdark, Unthril acquires enough CSF to last him about **two to three months**. This buffer allows him flexibility between ventures and reduces the frequency of risky trips.
  - The Mind Flayers provide the CSF in bulk containers (e.g., reinforced crates or flasks), which Unthril later breaks down into individual doses upon returning home.

### Rationale:
- **Portability vs. Risk**: Carrying 1–2 doses on his person ensures he has a backup in case of emergency, without exposing himself to the risk of losing a large supply if he's robbed or captured.
  
- **Venture Quantity**: Acquiring 60–90 days' worth per Underdark trip allows Unthril to balance the frequency of dangerous trips with the availability of human brains for trade.
