# Unthril Zond  
## Profile  
Unthril Zond is the leader of the [[Guild of Apothecaries & Physicians]] in [[Waterdeep]], based in the North Ward. Born in 1305 DR, he has lived an unnaturally long life through a dark pact with the Mind Flayers of [[Ch'Chitl]]. In exchange for a steady supply of fresh human brains—gathered from deceased patients preserved by the **gentle repose** spell—Unthril receives shipments of cerebral spinal fluid from the Mind Flayers, granting him longevity and psychic resistance.

At the [[House of Healing (Waterdeep)|House of Healing]] in Waterdeep, Unthril discreetly manages two crematories. While one serves the public for burning the dead, the other holds bodies enchanted with **[[gentle-repose|Gentle Repose]]**, their brains preserved for transport to the Underdark. Unthril himself smuggles these shipments to the Mind Flayers, maintaining the dark bargain that prolongs his life. He protects himself from psychic threats using a **[[Circlet of Intellect Guarding]]**, which shields him from psionics and psychic attacks.

Unthril lives in an elaborate townhouse in the North Ward, attended to by his faithful butler, **Randy Cubblepot**. Randy is devoted to Unthril, tending to his home and preparing meals from exotic ingredients that Unthril brings back from the Underdark. Randy is known for repeating Unthril’s commands back to him, always finishing with the phrase: *"Per Lord Zond, of course."* His loyalty is unwavering, and he maintains the household meticulously, despite the unsettling nature of the supplies that Unthril brings back.

### Unthril's Home and Arcade 
Though Unthril is wealthy, most of his personal funds are tied up in investments with [[Mirt]] the Moneylender. He has a private stash of silver, but it's locked behind a series of games within his personal arcade, accessible only by winning at these games.

### Potential Quest Hook  
**Quest: The Stolen Circlet**

**Description:** Unthril's **[[Circlet of Intellect Guarding]]** was recently stolen, and he is desperate to retrieve it. Without it, he feels vulnerable during his underdark dealings. He will ask adventurers to locate and return the circlet, offering rewards in return.

**Reward:**  (***One of the following***)
- Free healthcare at the House of Healing for the party.  
- Improved relations with Quasi-Open Lord [[Mirt]] the Moneylender.  
- If players inquire about monetary compensation, Unthril will challenge them to win games in his arcade, offering a portion of his private silver stash as a reward.
