## Upbringing & Hometown

Tim Brindleworth hails from the small town of **Daggerford**, a modest trade hub nestled along the Trade Way south of Waterdeep. The Brindleworth family, though not poor, were far from prosperous. Tim’s father **Barlow**, a massive bearded man, ran a once prosperous alchemy shop. By the time Tim was 6 years old, Barlow's alcholism and mismanagement had left the shop barely afloat leaving nothing real to inherit except overwhelming debts. 

The families modest lifestyle was cemented by their lack of ambition and acceptance of Barlow's destructive alcholism and complacency.

Tim, on the other hand, had greater ambitions. From a young age, he was fascinated by the stories of powerful guildmasters and wealthy merchants who held influence in Waterdeep, Baldur’s Gate, and beyond. These figures seemed larger than life, and Tim quickly developed an obsession with not just gaining wealth, but proving his worth in the eyes of society. He hated being from a "nobody family" in a "nowhere town" and vowed to change his destiny.

At 18, he left Daggerford behind, severing ties with his family who, in his eyes, embodied everything he despised: complacency. He made his way to Waterdeep, where he scraped by doing odd jobs, using his natural charm to land low-level positions in various guilds. It wasn’t long before he caught the attention of **Unthril Zond**, the ruthless Guildmaster of the Apothecaries and Physicians. Tim saw Unthril not only as a mentor but also as a stepping stone to power. He positioned himself as Unthril’s loyal aide, always doing the dirtiest of tasks without complaint, all the while dreaming of one day replacing him.

## Personality & Ambition

Tim is driven by an almost pathological need to prove his worth. He measures his value entirely by his position in the corporate and guild hierarchies. His goal is to one day run his own guild or business empire, where he can finally feel like he matters. This insecurity leads to a sycophantic loyalty to those above him, particularly Unthril, though his loyalty is only as deep as his ambition allows. Tim is more than willing to sell out anyone if it means advancing his own agenda.

He’s a master at office politics, playing people against each other and always managing to stay in the good graces of those in power. However, his overwhelming ambition makes him short-sighted at times, causing him to overlook long-term consequences for short-term gains.

## Roleplayable Quirks

1. **Perpetual Brown-Noser:**  
   Tim constantly praises, flatters, and ingratiates himself to anyone with even a shred of authority over him. He will never pass up an opportunity to compliment someone in power, and will often go overboard with it, sounding insincere to anyone paying close attention. For example:
   - *"Ah, Unthril, your insight is truly unmatched. Waterdeep is fortunate to have a leader like you!"*
   - *"What a fantastic plan, you’re always one step ahead of everyone else."*

   My players will likely find Tim's sycophantic behavior obnoxious, especially if they are in positions of power.

2. **Unrelenting Networking:**  
   Tim is constantly trying to "network," even when it’s not appropriate. He’ll frequently drop names of powerful people he’s met, even if those encounters were brief or meaningless. This gives him a false sense of importance. He’ll also insist on exchanging information, titles, or business cards with anyone who might be useful in the future, including the player characters.
   - *"You know, I once met Mirt the Moneylender. A bit of a legend, right? Yeah, we had drinks—well, I was in the same tavern, but I’m sure he remembers me."*

   This quirk will lead Tim to frequently interrupt conversations, pushing for connections or alliances that may seem trivial or awkward.

3. **Insecure Validation-Seeking:**  
   Tim is incredibly insecure and constantly needs validation to reassure himself of his worth. He might ask leading questions to fish for compliments or success stories that prove his contribution is meaningful. When the players complete a task or make a decision, Tim will often take credit or desperately seek approval for his minor role.
   - *"That went well, right? I mean, my advice really helped push things forward, didn’t it?"*
   - *"I knew following Unthril’s plan was the right call. Of course, I added a few tweaks here and there—small, but impactful."*

   Players can manipulate him by feeding into this need for validation, although doing so may encourage his ego and make him even more unbearable.

## How He Interacts with the Players

Tim will be extremely deferential to the players if they hold any status, power, or influence. He’ll do his best to ingratiate himself, offering to run errands, provide information, or offer help—though his aid always comes with an ulterior motive. If the players seem to have connections to powerful figures in Waterdeep or elsewhere, Tim will be all over them, eager to associate himself with their success.

However, if the players are of lower standing or appear weak, Tim may treat them with thinly veiled disdain or indifference, seeing no advantage in associating with "losers." His ambition blinds him to the potential consequences of underestimating people.

## Key Relationships

- **Unthril Zond (Guildmaster of the Guild of Apothecaries and Physicians):**  
   Tim idolizes Unthril, but only in the sense that Unthril represents the success Tim craves. He studies his boss closely, adopting his methods and even mimicking his mannerisms at times. Deep down, though, Tim resents Unthril for standing between him and true power. If the opportunity arose to supplant Unthril, Tim wouldn’t hesitate, though he currently lacks the resources and backing to make such a move.

- **Guild Members and Other Staff:**  
   Tim is both feared and ridiculed within the guild. Those beneath him hate his brown-nosing and backstabbing ways, but they also know that crossing Tim could lead to swift retaliation. Others see him as a joke—a sycophant with delusions of grandeur. Either way, Tim sees everyone in the guild as a stepping stone, a rival, or an obstacle.
