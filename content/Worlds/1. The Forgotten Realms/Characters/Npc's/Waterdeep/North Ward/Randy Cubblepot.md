# Randy Cubblepot
## Profile
Randy Cubblepot is the loyal butler to [[Unthril Zond]], serving him faithfully in the North Ward of [[Waterdeep]]. Originally from the subterranean city of [[Blingdenstone]], Randy hails from a long line of deep gnomes who specialized in crafting and mining before the city's tragic sacking by the Drow. Forced to flee Blingdenstone after the city fell, Randy found work in the surface world, serving powerful noble families in [[Mithral Hall]] and [[Silverymoon]] as a distinguished butler.

Now in the year 1502 DR, Randy serves the enigmatic Unthril Zond in Waterdeep, living within Zond's townhouse. Despite Zond's nefarious dealings with the Mind Flayers of [[Ch'Chitl]], Randy performs his duties with unwavering loyalty and diligence, though he occasionally offers Zond words of caution and advice when his master's pursuits become too dangerous.

### Past & Family

Though Randy has embraced his role in the surface world, part of him still longs for his subterranean roots. [[Blingdenstone]] has since been reclaimed, thanks in no small part to his nephew, [[Kargien Dissengulp#Lieutenants|Miglin Cubblepot]], who served as a lieutenant under the renowned leader [[Kargien Dissengulp]] during the prolonged war to reclaim the city from Drow occupation.

Randy was already too old to fight by the time the reclamation began, so he did not join his kin in their decades-long struggle. Nevertheless, he takes great pride in his nephew's accomplishments and frequently reminisces about the days when his family called Blingdenstone home. He hopes to visit the reclaimed city one day and reconnect with his family, though his duties and the many years of silence between them make that seem more of a dream than a reality.

### Loyalty and Conflict

While Randy is aware of his master's dark dealings, he has grown accustomed to the role of servitude and feels a strong sense of duty to fulfill his obligations. He does not condone Unthril's bargain with the Mind Flayers, but his deep gnome culture’s emphasis on perseverance and loyalty keeps him from abandoning his post. Randy sees himself as a voice of reason within the chaos that surrounds Unthril and tries to subtly influence his master towards less harmful decisions—though his suggestions are rarely heeded.

Randy maintains the household with precision and care, always ending his replies to Unthril with a polite echo of his master's command, saying: "*Per Lord Zond, of course*."

### Potential Quest Hook
**Quest**: Unthril's Circlet 

Description: Randy will let the players know that his Master Unthril has misplaced a crown recently, which Randy believes was stolen by some Tieflings that have been lurking around Zond property.

**Reward**:
- Increased trust from Randy, who will become a valuable ally in providing subtle information about Unthril Zond’s activities.
- Possiblity of connecting with Underdark contacts
- Randy's promise of lifelong loyalty, granting free lodging at Unthril's townhouse whenever the party is in Waterdeep.
