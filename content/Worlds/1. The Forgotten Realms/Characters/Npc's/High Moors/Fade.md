# Isolde Vayne
**Early Life**  
Fade was born in 1410 DR as **Isolde Vayne**, the daughter of a noble family in the city of [[Elversult]], nestled in the shadows of the Dragon Coast. Her family was wealthy and well-connected, but it all left Isolde feeling... bored. She longed for a something to come along and shake her life up, but that something never came and so she decided since this life was so dull she would abandon everything and let it all *fade* into the past.

**The Turning Point**  
At the age of 25, Isolde made the fateful decision to flee her family, seeking refuge in the nearby [[Cormanthor|Cormanthor Forest]]. Unbeknownst to her, the forest was home to an ancient vampire lord named Lucien.

Lucien found Isolde one moonless night, offering her power, freedom, and new experiences like nothing she could imagine in exchange for her loyalty. Desperate for a life that wasn't so painfully drab and predicitable she accepted undeath, and Lucien turned her into a vampire, severing her ties to her mortal life. She became his protégée, learning the ways of the night, mastering the art of seduction, and honing her abilities to manipulate shadows and minds.

**Rebirth as Fade**  
After decades under Lucien’s tutelage, Isolde took the name Fade, symbolizing her new identity and the erasure of her past. Though Lucien had promised her power, Fade grew weary of the endless nights spent in service to her master’s whims.

An opportunity to reinvigorate her fading interest in existence came when she encountered [[Lyra Dawnfury]], who was visiting Lucien to discuss an alliance between the Blood Hunter Order and the vampires of Cormanthor. Fade was captivated by Lyra’s vision and strength, seeing in her a kindred spirit who, like herself, was willing to do whatever it took to make something happen in the world. Lucien took an especial liking to Isolde and upon seeing a spark of interest in her eyes he allowed Isolde to be his personal representative in working with Lyra, thus giving his young protege the change of scenery she longed for.

Fade accepted without hesitation. She left Lucien and her old life behind, becoming one of Lyra’s most trusted lieutenants. Now, as Fade, she revels in her role, using her vampiric abilities to sow chaos and fear, ensuring the Order’s continued dominance. To her, the manipulation of mortals is a game, and with Lyra at her side, the world is her playground.
