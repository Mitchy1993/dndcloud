[[Dhampir]] Cleric (*Sehanine Moonbow*), Death Domain

Left in the [Dunwood Forest](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dunwood) by his mother as a fresh newborn in 1430 DR. 

Shango was found by a large pack of werewolves who took him in, initially intending to eat him. However, the boy showed exceptional bravery and never cried when about to be devoured, earning him the respect of each werewolf in the pack that tried to eat him. As the child grew it was clear he was strong and an asset to the pack.

They formally inducted him into their pack with "*The Biting*," a magical ritual and highest honor that could be bestowed on an outsider. Rather than forcing the curse of lycanthropy on an individual they pass it on out of love and acceptance rather than malice thereby passing on a far more controllable version of the curse.

During the ritual it was revealed, by taste, that Shango was a Dhampir. He did not have the scent of a vampire, but his blood was powerfully tainted with unholy power. 

When Shango was 30 years old he decided to leave the pack to track down his mother, whom he believed may still be alive.

His two closest friends Luna & Fenrir asked Shango to perform "*The Biting*" on them as a sign of love and solidarity despite whatever the future may bring. Shango obliged, mixing their werewolf blood with vampirism creating hybrid spawns.

He never found his mother, but he did find a family in the Order of the [[Blood Hunters]]. He now serves as a lieutenant, alongside Fade, working for [[Lyra Dawnfury]].
