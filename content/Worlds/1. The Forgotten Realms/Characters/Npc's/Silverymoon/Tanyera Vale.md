## **Tanyera Vale (deceased)**

#### What Tanyera Wanted:
- **Uncover the truth** behind magical anomalies in Silverymoon and surrounding regions.
- To use her skills as a **bladesinger** to **protect** those she loved and serve the city.
- Build a **safe future** for her daughter, **Vespera**, by teaching her balance between control and creativity in magic.
- **Reconnect with her husband**, Veloran, despite their growing professional and ideological differences.

#### What Tanyera Feared:
- The **dangers of forbidden magic** she encountered during her investigations, especially anything tied to **Netheril** or unstable, ancient sources of power.
- That her curiosity and need to investigate would **endanger her family**, especially Vespera, whom she wished to protect from dark forces.
- **Losing the trust** and connection with Veloran as they began to clash over how magic should be handled in their family and the city.

#### What Tanyera Lost:
- Her life during a **covert mission** for the Spellguard, officially recorded as a **training accident**, but secretly tied to her investigation into strange, dangerous magic.
- The opportunity to see her daughter, Vespera, grow and **develop as a wizard**, and to guide her on a path of balance between creativity and control.
- The **closeness** she once had with Veloran, as their views on magic became more polarized, and her independent spirit began to create tension in their relationship.

## History:
Tanyera Vale was a highly skilled **elven bladesinger**, known for her grace in combat and her sharp intellect. She met **Veloran Vale** while both were serving Silverymoon—he as a rising figure in the Spellguard, and she as a specialist in investigating magical threats. They fell in love, despite their differing approaches to magic—Veloran’s being strict and orderly, while Tanyera’s was more investigative and adaptable.

Tanyera had an insatiable curiosity about ancient magic, often leading her into dangerous research missions. She became particularly interested in the arcane remnants of **Netheril** and other forbidden areas of study. Unbeknownst to many, Tanyera was investigating an unsettling magical anomaly at the time of her death, though the official record labeled it a **training accident**.

Her death left a deep scar on her family, especially her daughter, **Vespera Vale**, who inherited Tanyera’s more free-spirited approach to magic, creating further tension with Veloran. Tanyera’s absence looms over both her husband and daughter, shaping their views on magic and their fractured relationship.
