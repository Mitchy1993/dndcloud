# # Veloran Vale
## Profile

#### What Veloran Wants:
- **Control** over magic in Silverymoon to prevent misuse and chaos.
- To decipher the **[[Alustriel's Warning|mysterious message]]** from Alustriel Silverhand, which references **Karsus** and **Netheril**, and understand the threat it poses.
- **Order and discipline** within the Spellguard, pushing his subordinates to be the ultimate defenders of Silverymoon.

#### What Veloran Fears:
- The **return of catastrophic magic** like Karsus’ Folly, and the resurgence of **Netheril's destruction**.
- Losing control over the city's magical defenses, or worse, seeing **Silverymoon** fall to reckless magical forces.
- His daughter, **Vespera**, embracing dangerous magic that could endanger her and the city.
	- Losing his daughter the same way he lost her mother.

#### What Veloran Has Lost:
- The **close relationship** with his daughter, Vespera, due to their ideological differences over magic (he values strict control, while she embraces chaos).
- The simplicity of his earlier years serving under **Taern Hornblade**; now the weight of leading the Spellguard and managing political tensions in the city consumes him.
- [[Tanyera Vale]], his wife, on a mission for the [[Spellguard]], officially labeled a training accident.

## History
Veloran Vale, the stern and disciplined Master of the Spellguard of Silverymoon, commands his forces with an unwavering sense of duty. A master abjurer, he has dedicated his life to protecting Silverymoon from magical threats, holding an almost militant view of magic itself—believing it must be tightly controlled to prevent catastrophe. He ascended to his current position when Taern Hornblade became High Mage of Silverymoon, and has since focused on defending the city from any misuse of magic, enforcing strict magical laws.

Veloran recently received a cryptic message from Alustriel Silverhand, referencing **Karsus**, **Netheril**, and a mysterious figure named **Dekarios**. He is obsessively working to decipher this message, fearing that the ancient horrors of Netheril’s fall could be resurfacing, threatening the delicate balance he has worked to maintain.

His relationship with his daughter, **Vespera Vale**, is strained, as her free-spirited approach to magic and fascination with chaos and the Feywild contrasts sharply with Veloran's strict adherence to order.
