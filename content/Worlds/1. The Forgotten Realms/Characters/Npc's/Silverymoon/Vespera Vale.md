# Vespera Vale
## Profile

#### What Vespera Wants:
- To explore and master **creative, chaotic magic**, especially that of the **Feywild**, without being shackled by her father's rigid rules.
- **Freedom** to study and experiment with magic in her own way, finding new, unorthodox applications for spells.
- **Join the [[Spellguard]]** and believes that if she can show the world why chaos magic is so incredible they'll have to accept her and hopefully her father will understand and approve of her finally.

#### What Vespera Fears:
- Being **restricted** by the Spellguard or other authorities that suppress her magical curiosity.
- **Losing her sense of self** and identity by conforming to rigid societal rules or her father's expectations.

#### What Vespera Has Lost:
- A **close connection** with her father, Veloran. Their relationship is strained due to their conflicting views on magic.
- Tanya Vale, her mother, in an training accident in the [[Spellguard]].

## History
Vespera Vale is a bright, passionate wizard who walks the line between curiosity and chaos. Unlike her father, Veloran, she embraces the untamed nature of magic, particularly its chaotic side, and has become deeply fascinated with the Feywild. Her study of transmutation and wild magic has led her to explore new and unpredictable ways to manipulate the Weave, and her time spent studying fey magic has only deepened her appreciation for the spontaneity that magic can bring.

Her rebellious nature frequently brings her into conflict with her father, who believes that all magic must be controlled and ordered. Vespera, however, thrives in creativity and sees magic as an art form rather than a tool to be strictly regulated. This difference in philosophy has created a rift between them, but Vespera remains fiercely independent, though secretly longing for her father's approval.

Vespera often finds herself drawn to the [[Feywild]]

- Vespara's best child hood friend is [[Cassian Drake]]
