An enigmatic shadow druid, who wishes nothing but to become one with the Shadow's and to help all Druid's realize that when sentients occupy an area they brighten it with their bright lights and decimate the land however they see fit, but they cower before darkness. In the dark, those who most commonly destroy nature are lost while nature is able to thrive and expand.
