<small> Sorcerer of [[The Forgotten]] <big>
![[Eldrin.jpg]]
[[Eldrin.png]]
Previously a powerful sorcerer, and one of the [[Lords of Waterdeep]]. 

Eldrin willingly studied at [[Blackstaff Tower]], despite his innate abilities, Eldrin was fascinated by the [[Weave]] and it's power. He experimented with how it flows through all things and it's ability to connect the world.

Eldrin is not Plaguechanged like the rest of [[The Forgotten]],  however he did willingly take the risk of obtaining a [[spellscar]]. His scar allows him to rip portals in the Weave, with great energy cost to himself and teleport nearly anywhere in the material plane so long as he knows where the destination is.

The greater the distance the more it drains him.

During his [[Scar Pilgrimages]], Eldrin met [[Arandur]] in the [[Plaguewrought Land]], and befriend him. It was Arandur who helped Eldrin successfully obtain his spellscar and the two remained in contact until one day Arundur approached him with an offer to serve the Weave Eater & learn more about the Weave than even the God's themselves know. 

As a servant of [[Karthus]], Eldrin is fascinated by the [[Karsite Weave]] and stays on the cutting edge of it's growth, using it as an alternative to Mystra's [[Weave]].
