After the [Time of Troubles](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Time_of_Troubles "Time of Troubles"), [Gondarism](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gond "Gond") was the state religion of Lantan.[[20]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lantan#cite_note-F&A-pp62-63-20) [Clerics](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cleric "Cleric") of Gond were called "krii", a Lantanna word that actually meant "disadvantaged".[[20]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lantan#cite_note-F&A-pp62-63-20)

Though Gond was the primary faith, one could still find shrines to other deities for the sake of foreign visitors.[[21]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lantan#cite_note-21)

### Government[](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lantan?veaction=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Government")

The island nation was ruled by a council of twelve, called the [Ayrorch](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ayrorch "Ayrorch"). The Ayrorch itself was led by the Ayrar. The Lantar was the Ayrorch's representative to other lands. The remaining ten members were known as Santar, an ancient Lantanna word for "others".[[1]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lantan#cite_note-FRCS-CotR-pp55-56-1)
