- Chaulssin was a drow city in the Underdark, known as the "City of Wyrmshadows."
- It was located beneath the northern Rauvin Mountains, overhanging a deep abyss.
- The city was partially brought into the [[Shadowfell]] after being conquered by shadow dragons, causing shadowy tendrils and creatures to haunt the streets.
- Chaulssin was largely unknown due to its remote location, making it an ideal stronghold for the secretive [Jaezred Chaulssin](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Jaezred_Chaulssin) brotherhood.
- By the time of the [War of the Spider Queen](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/War_of_the_Spider_Queen), the city was in decline, mostly abandoned, with only small shadar-kai bands and dark bears remaining.
- The [zekylyn](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Zar%27ithra) lived in the city's upper galleries, training under the Patron Fathers, while the zar'thra'rin controlled the lesser tunnels, led by the strongest male.
- The ilharen'quarthen, female concubines of the Patron Fathers, lived in luxurious apartments around Patron Grandfather Mauzzkyl Jaezred's home.
- By 1372 DR, Chaulssin served as the headquarters of the Jaezred Chaulssin, a group of powerful assassins and worshipers of Vhaeraun.
