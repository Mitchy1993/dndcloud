Menzoberranzan (MEN-zoh-buh-RAN-zan), the City of Spiders, was a large underground drow city-state in the Upper Northdark. Menzoberranzan was possibly the most well-known drow city in Faer√ªn. It was the home of Drizzt Do'Urden, and many of his early adventures dealt with the political intrigue and characters of the city.

**Surface**  
Menzoberranzan was located in the Upper Northdark, about 3.2 km (2 miles) below the Surbrin Valley, between the Moonwood and the Frost Hills. It was quite close to Mithral Hall and was connected through tunnels to that settlement. Other tunnels led to the surface, including ones in the Moonwood and on the western edge of the High Forest. Drygully Tunnel was a tunnel leading from the Underdark near Menzoberranzan to the surface.

**Underdark**  
The deep gnome city Blingdenstone was located about 45 miles to the west of Menzoberranzan. Ched Nasad was some distance to the southwest on the other side of Araumycos, a journey of several tendays from Menzoberranzan. The path through Ammarindar was the quickest route between Menzoberranzan and Ched Nasad, but it was less traveled due to the danger that lurked there.
