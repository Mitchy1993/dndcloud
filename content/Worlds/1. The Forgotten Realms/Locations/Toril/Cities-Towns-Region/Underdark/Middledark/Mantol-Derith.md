Mantol-Derith (MAN-toll-DARE-ith) was a trading city situated in an underground cavern three miles below the surface.

Its exact location was not known by many. It was situated on the shores of the [[Darklake]], across from which was the duergar city of [[Gracklstugh]]. The nearest drow settlement was [[Menzoberranzan]], or [[Ched Nasad]] before that city's destruction.
