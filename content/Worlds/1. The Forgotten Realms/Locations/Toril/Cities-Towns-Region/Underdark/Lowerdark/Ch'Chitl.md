Ch'Chitl (ch-CHIT-ill) was a city of mind flayers located about 18 miles (28.97 km) beneath the southernmost foothills of the Sword Mountains, close to Waterdeep.

The settlement's upper portion was hard to notice, as it was not in a conspicuous area and only consisted of a medium-sized warren of tunnels and caves where the quaggoth lived. Six spiral staircases led from the [Quaggoth](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Quaggoth) Caverns to the lower portion of the city, known as the Ring Caverns. This area, carved from ancient igneous stone, resembled a typical mind flayer settlement. The mind flayers inhabited the six Ring Caverns, each of which had an outer ring surrounding a circular central plaza, linked by tubes.

As of the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR, the settlement's economy was primarily based on raiding, with some trading with other enclaves in the Underdark. It could sell psionic items and quaggoth soldiers.

**Geography**  
Ch'Chitl was accessible primarily from Undermountain, from [[Dolblunde]] via tunnels from Maden's Tomb Tor, and from the catacombs of the [House of Stone](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/House_of_Stone). Further access points included the hamlets of [Bowshot](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bowshot) and [Gillian's Hill](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gillian%27s_Hill) near [[Daggerford]]. Denizens of Ch'Chitl could also easily access trading routes to [[Skullport]], and use those to reach Eryndlyn, Gracklstugh, the mines of Mirabar, and other distant enclaves.
