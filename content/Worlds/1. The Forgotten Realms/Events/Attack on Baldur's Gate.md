In the year 1492 DR, [[Baldur's Gate]] was attacked by a giant Netherbrain & a mindflayer onslaught. Many were transformed in an instant & swathe's more were ravaged by the newborn starving aberrations.

Sadly the losses were catastrophic that day, the city Cleric's did their upmost to heal the wounded and bring back the dead, but the cost of resurrection is far more expensive than the common person can afford; most would remain dead aside from a few exceptions.

For those who lived on to tell the tale it was one of the most painful experiences of their lives and it left many communities shattered.
