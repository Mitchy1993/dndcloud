**Leader:** [Unthril  Zond](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Unthril_Zond)

### Public Agenda
This is one of the richest guilds in Waterdeep, and has a somewhat checkered history. On several occasions, its members have been implicated in smuggling, fraudulent investment affairs, and similar instances of criminally imprudent investments of their monies. No doubt some of their fellows remain rich and maintain shady connections. 

This guild has also been at odds with the [[Lords of Waterdeep|Lords]] in lobbying and legislature; repeatedly the guild has tried to have all non-guild medical practitioners (including all clerics) banned from practicing in Waterdeep (*eliminating any competition*). 

The Lords have strenuously resisted such efforts, and arrested high ranking members for assassination attempts on two occasions of Open Lord [Piergeiron](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Piergeiron_Paladinson).

### Medical Efficacy

Despite the faults and politics of its members, the guild does provide services of **high quality**. It maintains a **Formulary** in its headquarters (open to members only) that records agreed-upon formulae for many drugs and other medicinal remedies. 

It also keeps in stock some of the **rarest ingredients** needed to make these medicines, dealing with **far-faring sea captains**, traveling merchants, and caravan leaders to gain these from the far reaches of the Realms. 

Medical aid in Waterdeep is expensive
