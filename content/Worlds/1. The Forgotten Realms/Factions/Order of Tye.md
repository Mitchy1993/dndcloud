## Overview
**Summary**:  
The **Order of Tye** is a military organization tasked with overseeing naval operations for [[Waterdeep]], expanding their original duty of escorting dignitaries "outside the city walls" to include all maritime ventures. With an emphasis on rigorous training and discipline, the order is seen as Waterdeep's equivalent to modern-day marines. Their current leader, **[[Admirius Ackbar]]**, is a seasoned Triton whose unparalleled expertise in aquatic environments brought a tactical edge to the order’s naval forces.

#### What the Organization Wants:
- To ensure Waterdeep’s naval superiority and safeguard its sea lanes.
- To maintain strict discipline and elevate the prestige of the Waterdeep Navy.
- Expand influence over coastal regions and protect allied merchant fleets.
  
#### What the Organization Fears:
- The resurgence of piracy, particularly from [[Luskan]] or other rogue cities.
- Internal political struggles that could undermine their authority.
- The encroachment of underwater threats from the deep sea or the Underdark.

#### What the Organization Has Lost:
- The personal leadership of [[Lord Peneshay]], who stepped down after years of service.
- Several key naval vessels to pirate raids and sea monsters in recent years.
- Respect from rival nations who question Waterdeep's naval strength after recent losses.

## Etymology
The **Order of Tye** draws its name from a now-obscure Waterdhavian dialect where "Tye" referred to "safe passage" or "escort." Originally, the order was focused on land-based escort missions but evolved over time to encompass all external defense operations—particularly at sea.

## Activities
**Primary Activities**:  
- Escorting key individuals and important cargo to and from Waterdeep, ensuring protection from pirates or enemy fleets.
- Regular patrols along the Sword Coast to protect Waterdeep’s interests.
- Maintaining naval superiority through rigorous training programs for all marine forces.
- Conducting rescue and recovery missions in dangerous waters.

## Society
### Beliefs
- **Honor Above All**: The order lives by a strict code of honor, placing duty and loyalty to Waterdeep at the forefront.
- **Semper Fidelis (Always Faithful)**: This motto drives their actions, fostering unshakable bonds of camaraderie, especially among the naval forces.
- **Might of the Sea**: Tritons, such as Ackbar, believe the sea itself is a living entity that they must respect and protect. The order embraces this belief as part of their naval culture.

### Culture
- **Brotherhood at Sea**: Tye Fighters share a bond forged through intense, grueling training. From officers to deckhands, they operate with seamless coordination, resembling a well-oiled machine.
- **Ceremonial Launches**: New recruits participate in a ceremonial dive into the sea to symbolize their "rebirth" into the Order of Tye, mirroring Ackbar’s Triton customs.
- **Respect for the Old Guard**: While naval soldiers often clash with city-based authorities, they hold deep respect for the older generation of Tye Fighters, including Lord Peneshay.

### Religion
Though no formal religion governs the Order of Tye, many members revere **[[Valkur]]**, the god of sailors, and **[[Umberlee]]** out of both respect and fear. Triton members, led by Ackbar, often pay homage to **[[Eadro]]**, a god of water and aquatic creatures.

## History
**Founding**:  
The **Order of Tye** was originally founded to protect noble caravans and dignitaries traveling outside Waterdeep’s walls. However, as Waterdeep's influence expanded and maritime threats grew, the order was restructured to handle naval affairs by the late 14th century DR. 

**Key Events**:  
- **1372 DR**: Lord Peneshay, a noble knight, assumes command of the order and expands its mission to include naval defense.
- **1480 DR**: A daring rescue by Triton citizen **Admirius Ackbar** saves Peneshay’s life when a pirate ambush strands him at sea. This act propels Ackbar into the ranks of the Tye Fighters.
- **1485 DR**: Ackbar, now head of the Order, institutes sweeping reforms, blending Triton combat tactics with the traditional discipline of the order, making the naval forces more versatile and deadly.

## Rumors & Legends
- **"Ackbar's Curse"**: Some whisper that Ackbar made a pact with the deep-sea entities to save Peneshay’s life. While there is no proof, sailors report seeing strange aquatic creatures trailing behind the Leviathan's Roar.
- **The Ghost Fleet**: Sailors speak of an invisible fleet said to serve the Order, emerging only in times of great need to reinforce Waterdeep's navy.
- **Peneshay’s Return**: Though Lord Peneshay retired, rumors persist that he secretly advises Ackbar on crucial matters, watching over the order from the shadows.
