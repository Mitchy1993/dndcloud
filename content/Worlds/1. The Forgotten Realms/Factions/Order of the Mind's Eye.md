### History
#### Founding and Early Years (circa 1245 DR)
- **Origins:** The Order of the Mind's Eye was founded in 1245 DR by a small group of mystics who independently discovered the secrets of psionics. These founders were hermits and outcasts, drawn together by a shared vision of using their mental powers to protect the realms from unseen threats. Their bond was not one of camaraderie but of necessity, as their powers and the understanding of their potential could only be fully explored through mutual cooperation.
- **Mission:** The Order’s mission has always been twofold: to master the depths of psionics through intense self-reflection and to protect the realms from psionic and mental threats that traditional arcane or divine magic cannot address.
- **Secretive Beginnings:** Operating in isolation, the Order remained hidden from the world for many years, with each member focusing on inner mastery. Their secluded existence allowed them to observe, detect, and intervene in psionic threats with subtlety, avoiding attention from other factions in Faerûn.

#### The Rise of the Soul Knife Division (circa 1300 DR)
- **Birth of a New Path:** As the Order grew and encountered more frequent and complex threats, a rift began to form within its ranks. Some members recognized that the abstract, contemplative methods of the mystics were not always sufficient to address the practical realities of the world. This led to the formation of the Soul Knife division around 1300 DR—a faction within the Order dedicated to direct action, utilizing their psionic abilities as weapons rather than purely for defense or exploration.
- **Controversial Acceptance:** The creation of the Soul Knife division was met with mixed reactions. Traditionalists within the Order viewed this new approach as a departure from the true path of psionic mastery, fearing it could lead to the corruption of their ideals. However, the effectiveness of the Soul Knives in dealing with immediate threats could not be denied, leading to their begrudging acceptance as a necessary force within the Order.
- **Distinct Leadership:** Due to the distinct nature of their mission, the Soul Knives were granted their own leader, who operated independently yet in coordination with the overall leader of the Order. This dual leadership structure was designed to balance the contemplative nature of the Order with the practical realities of the world.

#### The Absolute Conflict (Late 15th Century DR)
- **The Absolute Conflict:** In recent years, the Sword Coast was threatened by the rise of a powerful entity known as "The Absolute," an Elder Brain controlled by three powerful figures: [[Orin the Red]], [[Ketheric Thorm]], and [[Enver Gortash]].

  The Order of the Mind's Eye, under the overall leadership of Grandmaster [[Elara Duskheart]], and with the Soul Knives led by [[Kerion Duskheart]], played a subtle yet crucial role in this conflict. While the primary opposition to the Absolute came from a group of adventurers who ultimately destroyed the entity, the Order’s mystics, particularly the Soul Knives, quietly disrupted the Elder Brain’s operations. They infiltrated key locations, sabotaged the Mind Flayers' thralls, and ensured that the Elder Brain's influence was weaker than it might otherwise have been. Their actions were deliberately kept in the shadows, ensuring that the credit for the victory would fall to the adventurers, as intended.

- **Growing Influence of the Soul Knives:** The success of the Soul Knives during the Absolute conflict significantly bolstered their standing within the Order. Under Korin Killshade's leadership, the division began to push for a more assertive role in the Order's operations, advocating for a more proactive approach to dealing with threats. This shift has created growing tension within the Order, as traditionalists fear the Soul Knives' influence may lead the entire organization down a path that diverges from its original purpose.

#### The Current State of the Order (1502 DR)
- **Fragmented Leadership:** Today, the Order of the Mind’s Eye faces internal divisions. Grandmaster [[Elara Duskheart]], a traditionalist, seeks to maintain the Order’s focus on introspection and subtlety, emphasizing the original mission of mastering the mind to protect the realms. However, [[Kerion Duskheart]], leader of the Soul Knives, advocates for a more aggressive approach, arguing that the Order must adapt to a world that increasingly requires action over contemplation.
  
- **Internal Strife:** The differing philosophies between the overall leadership and the Soul Knife division have led to growing fractures within the Order. While still united under a common purpose, the balance between contemplation and action is becoming more precarious, with some fearing that the Order could split entirely if a resolution is not found.
  
- **Public Perception:** The Order’s secrecy, once its greatest strength, has become a source of suspicion. The Soul Knives' recent actions, while effective, have drawn unwanted attention, leading to rumors and mistrust among other factions in Faerûn. The Order now faces the challenge of maintaining its traditional values while adapting to a changing world that increasingly demands transparency and direct intervention.

### Location
- **The Citadel of the Mind's Eye:** Hidden within the Spine of the World mountains, the Citadel is a fortress of the mind as much as it is of stone. Its exact location is known only to the highest-ranking members of the Order, and it is warded against both physical and psychic intrusion. The Citadel is a place of meditation and training, where mystics go to confront the deepest recesses of their minds.

### Leadership Structure
- **Grandmaster of the Order:** [[Elara Duskheart]]—The overall leader of the Order of the Mind's Eye, Elara Duskheart is a powerful psion and traditionalist who believes in the Order's original mission of introspection and subtle intervention. She is dedicated to maintaining the Order's focus on mastering the mind and protecting the realms from unseen threats.
  
- **Master of the Soul Knives:** [[Kerion Duskheart]]—As the fearsome leader of the Soul Knife division, Korin Killshade is a name that strikes fear into the hearts of those who oppose the Order. Known for his ruthless efficiency and mastery of stealth, Korin has shaped the Soul Knives into a deadly force, unafraid to take swift and decisive action against any threat. His leadership has pushed the division to the forefront of the Order's operations, often in ways that challenge the traditionalist values of the organization.
