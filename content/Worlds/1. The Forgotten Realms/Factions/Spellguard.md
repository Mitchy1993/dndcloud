# Spellguard of [[Silverymoon]]
## Overview
**Summary**:  
The Spellguard is the elite arcane force responsible for defending Silverymoon from magical threats, maintaining order, and enforcing magical law. Led by Veloran Vale, they are dedicated to protecting the city’s citizens and preserving the stability of magic within the city.

#### What the Spellguard Wants:
- **Preserve the magical stability** of Silverymoon and prevent any misuse of magic within its borders.
- **Uncover the true meaning** behind Alustriel [[Alustriel's Warning|Silverhand’s cryptic message]], which hints at ancient dangers from Netheril.
- **Enforce strict control** over magic and uphold the law within Silverymoon.

#### What the Spellguard Fears:
- The **resurgence of Netheril’s destructive magic** or other catastrophes like **Karsus’ Folly**.
- **Loss of control** over magical elements in Silverymoon, leading to chaos or external invasions.
- **Subversive magical threats** from within or outside the city that bypass their defenses.

#### What the Spellguard Has Lost:
- The **guidance of their former leader**, Taern Hornblade, after he became High Mage of Silverymoon.
- **A sense of complacency**, as rising magical threats, such as the cryptic references to **Karsus** and **Dekarios**, challenge their abilities and vigilance.
- Some **public trust** as factions within Silverymoon question the strict measures taken by the Spellguard to control magic.

Internally, the Spellguard operates as a **strict military order**, with a clear hierarchy and intense discipline. Members are chosen based on magical ability and loyalty to the city. They respect authority and prioritize the safety of the city above individual desires. Outsiders view them as rigid and unyielding.

### Religion

The Spellguard was formed centuries ago to provide Silverymoon with an arcane force capable of defending against magical threats. Their role expanded over time to include not only protection but also **magical law enforcement** within the city.

**Key Events**:
- **Taern Hornblade’s departure** to become High Mage left the Spellguard under the leadership of Veloran Vale, marking a transition to stricter enforcement and an increased focus on proactive defense.
- The recent cryptic message from Alustriel Silverhand has pushed the Spellguard into overdrive, with their leader Veloran Vale obsessed with deciphering the references to **Netheril** and **Dekarios**.

- **Secret experiments**: There are whispers that Veloran Vale may be conducting secret experiments with forbidden magic in an attempt to prepare for a potential Netheril resurgence.
