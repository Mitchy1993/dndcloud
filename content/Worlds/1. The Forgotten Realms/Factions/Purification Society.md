# `=this.file.name` Ideology

1. Race Supremacy: The Purification Society believes in the inherent superiority of certain races, which they claim are descended directly from the ancient Creator Races. These "pure" races are considered the rightful rulers of the world, while other races are seen as corruptions or deviations from the divine plan. The Society seeks to preserve the racial hierarchy by hunting and exterminating so-called inferior races.


2. Artistic Hunting: The Society sees hunting as an art form. Their members pride themselves on mastering the strategy, combat techniques, and rituals involved in hunting inferior races. This is not just warfare; it is a sacred and aesthetic practice for the Society, symbolizing the restoration of balance and purity to the world.


3. Prophecy of Redemption: Central to the Society’s mission is a prophecy they claim to have unearthed from ancient texts of the Creator Races. It foretells that the world can only be returned to its utopian state by purging all inferior races. The Society views this task as their divine duty, believing they are the chosen instruments to make the "tough choices" necessary to bring about the prophecy’s fulfillment.

### Hierarchy of Races

The Purification Society believes that certain races are divinely ordained to shape the world for the better, and they structure their society around this hierarchy.

1. **Humans**: Humans are esteemed for their diversity, ambition, and adaptability, and are often viewed as natural leaders. In the eyes of the Society, humans are blessed by multiple Creator Races, making them one of the most versatile and dominant races.


2. **Elves**: Revered for their wisdom, longevity, and close connection to nature, elves are seen as nearly divine beings, descended directly from the fey. They epitomize grace, sophistication, and intellect.


3. **Gnomes**: Valued for their intellect, creativity, and magical innovation, gnomes hold a respected place in the Society. They are believed to be a product of the Creator Races' intellectual pursuits, embodying the perfect blend of magic and technology.


4. **Dragonborn**: Dragonborn are feared and admired for their draconic heritage, which is seen as a divine gift from the primordial dragons. They are respected as powerful warriors and natural leaders in battle, enforcing the Society’s will with strength.


5. **Dwarves**: Recognized for their craftsmanship, resilience, and honor, dwarves are considered vital contributors to society. The Society believes dwarves were shaped by the Creator Giants to be the ultimate artisans and defenders of civilization.


6. **Halflings**: Accepted for their likeness to humans, halflings are praised for their luck, adaptability, resilience, and resourcefulness. Though not at the pinnacle of society, they are seen as useful and trustworthy allies.


7. **Tieflings**: Treated cautiously due to their infernal lineage, tieflings occupy a controversial space in the Society. They may be tolerated for their individual merits, but they are never fully trusted, seen as tainted by their fiendish origins.


8. **Others** (Inferior Races): The Society categorizes a wide range of races as "inferior," viewing them as corruptions of the divine order, mistakes of creation, or unnatural hybrids. These races are often hunted, enslaved, or exterminated, as part of the Society’s goal of achieving a "purified" world.

**Orcs**: Considered savage and warlike, believed to be a corruption of the titanic races.

**Goblins**: Seen as degenerate and cruel, offshoots of a once-greater race, now primitive.

**Kenku**: Viewed as fallen, cursed creatures, their wings and voices lost as a punishment from the gods.

**Kobolds**: Regarded as lesser reptilian beings, often enslaved or exterminated.

**Deep Gnomes** (Svirfneblin): A corrupted version of the gnome race, seen as twisted and dangerous due to their association with the Underdark.

**Yuan-ti**: Believed to be a perversion of the sarrukh’s work, yuan-ti are seen as manipulative and deceitful, deserving of extermination.

**Lizardfolk**: Considered primitive and animalistic, a relic of an earlier age.

**Gnolls**: Seen as savage creatures, their demonic influence makes them irredeemable.

**Tritons**: Distrusted for their isolationist tendencies and their perceived otherworldliness.

**Hobgoblins**: Feared for their military prowess but despised for their ruthless, warlike culture.

**Drow**: The Drow, though disliked, are generally avoided by the Society due to their power and dangerous reputation. While the Society believes them to be a "fallen" race of elves, they do not actively hunt them, preferring not to provoke conflict with the Drow unless necessary.

#### Historical Basis: The Creator Races

The Purification Society draws much of its ideology from ancient texts and interpretations of the Creator Races, the first beings who shaped the world of Toril in its early days. They believe that the superior races are directly descended from these beings, while inferior races are either corruptions of the Creator Races’ work or were created by dark gods and demons.

Sarrukh: The Society acknowledges the sarrukh’s role in creating many reptilian races but views those creations as flawed or incomplete. Races like yuan-ti and lizardfolk are seen as failed experiments, deserving of destruction.

Aearee: The Society venerates the avian Aearee as creators of noble bird-like beings, but considers races like kenku a tragic fall from their former glory.

Batrachi: The amphibious races created by the Batrachi, such as trolls and troglodytes, are considered primitive and chaotic, contributing nothing to civilization and thus marked for extinction.

Fey: The Society places great importance on the fey's influence, holding elves in particular reverence as the direct descendants of these magical beings.

Giants/Titans: Dwarves, goliaths, and even humans are believed to be linked to the work of the Creator Giants or titans, who shaped the world with strength and endurance. The Society sees these races as essential to upholding civilization.

### Key Beliefs

**Divine Right**: The Purification Society sees their mission as divinely ordained. They believe they are fulfilling the Creator Races’ vision for the world by restoring the racial hierarchy to its "natural" order.

**Extermination as Mercy**: The Society believes that by exterminating inferior races, they are "liberating" them from their inherent flaws and imperfections. They view this as a necessary, albeit tragic, mercy.

**Slavery as Penance**: The Society believes that, while living, inferior races can neutralize their negative impact on the world through their servitude. While this is a temporary solution to satisfying the Prophecy of Redemption death for them is the true solution.

**Utopia through Bloodshed**: The Society’s ultimate goal is to bring about a utopian future foretold in the Prophecy of Redemption. They believe this can only be achieved through the purging of inferior races and the return to the original divine plan of creation.
