### Dekarios Foundation for Orphan's & Marginalized Races
#### D.F.O.M.

The **Dekarios Foundation** was established in 1494 DR by Morena Dekarios in Waterdeep. With a mission to provide housing, nourishment, and education to orphans and less fortunate minority races such as kobolds, half-orcs, and kenkus, the foundation quickly gained recognition for its compassionate work.

The [[Waterdeep Sanctuary]] is a direct result of efforts made by the Dekarios Foundation
