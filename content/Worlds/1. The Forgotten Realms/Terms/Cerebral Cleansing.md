# Cerebral Cleansing

## Summary
**Cerebral Cleansing** is a powerful arcane punishment used in [[Waterdeep]] for the worst criminals. It permanently erases an individual’s memory, personality, and free will, turning them into **[[Obedient Servant]]s**. This process is irreversible, leaving the individual a blank slate, fully compliant through the use of **Obedience Collars**.

## Key Points

- **Legal Status**: Those subjected to Cerebral Cleansing are classified as **property** and sold as **Obedient Servants**.
