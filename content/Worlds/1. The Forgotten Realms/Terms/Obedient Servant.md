# Obedient Servants

## Summary
Obedient Servants are mind-wiped criminals, stripped of memory and free will through **Cerebral Cleansing**. Fitted with **Obedience Collars**, they follow any command and are sold as property to nobles, temples, and guilds for labor.

## Key Points
- **Labor**: Perform menial tasks (cleaning, manual work).
- **Legal Status**: Considered property, strictly regulated.
- **Ethical Debate**: Viewed as inhumane by some (good-aligned temples); justified for dealing with dangerous criminals.
- **Rarity**: Few qualify, making them rare and valuable.
