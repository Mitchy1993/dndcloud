*"One look at the Nether scroll and I've learned what a spell is. I've been collecting spells as if every one were different. That's illusion...spells are all the same. They're all a path through illusion to truth. One look, and I've seen the fundamental truth of magic"*

*Reading the Nether Scrolls instantly begins a contested skill challenge*

### Rules 
- Scrolls roll with a +14 to set the DC for each contest 
	- Nat 1's are not failures for the ***Nether Scrolls***
- Player rolls Arcana or Constitution for each contest 
- Player must obtain at least one success in order to not be driven [[long-term-madness|Mad]]
- The party levels up for every success

After the skill challenge is completed successfully the reader knows the [[Plot of Karthus]] & the history of [[Karsus Lore]]
- Success on 2 or more allows the player to gain a [[Nether Scrolls#5 Chapters|chapter]] power of their choice.

The unlocking of the Nether Scrolls alerts [[Karthus]] and after the party gains the knowledge they must make a DC 26 Arcana or Constitution save to hang onto the scroll as every character who leveled up suffers the effects of a 9th level [[thunderwave]].

- [[Cult of the Weave Eater]] forces will be dispatched to the location taking (1d4) hours to arrive
- If the party survives they may pick up the scroll and take it with them to make the skill challenge once a week to gain more levels, however each challenge that ends in a success will repeat the [[thunderwave]] and Weave Eater forces being alerted.

## 5 Chapters 
*Each chapter was the length of 10 normal scrolls*
### Arcanus Fundare
The chapter "Foundations of Magic" was about fundamental magic. It gave the reader an instant boost to their spells' effectiveness and magical skill matching and/or surpassing that of true masters, but no additional base magical power.

### Magicus Creare
The chapter "Spells of Creation" was about magic item creation. Reading it provided the user with the ability to create new magic items and the ability to create any magic item with less expenditure of one's essence.

### Maior Creare
The chapter "Major Creation" dealt also with the creation of magic items but with the focus on constructs. It made the reader not only understand how to create constructs but also how to reliably create them at top quality without any fluctuation.

### Planus Mechanus
The chapter "Studies of the Planes" dealt with the planes and allowed the reader to use plane shift and not suffer any negative effects from other planes' environments.

### Ars Factum
The chapter "Of the Creation of Artifacts" had contents that were unknown, though naturally, it was suspected to deal with making artifacts. This chapter's scrolls required some kind of key to be read, but it was never discovered.
