*"One look at a Nether scroll and I've learned what a spell is. I've been collecting spells as if every one were different. That's the illusion...spells are all the same. The scrolls are a path through illusion to truth. One look, and I've seen for the first time what the Weave is..."* - ***Anonymous Reader***

### Revelation: The Weave as the Fabric of Reality
*"You have believed that magic is a force that can be called upon, a separate energy you manipulate, but now you see the truth. The Weave **is** reality. It is the unseen structure that holds the world together, and every time you cast a spell you are not expelling power into the world, you are rearranging its very fabric.*

*The Weave is not just magic; it is the pattern upon which **everything** exists. All things—matter, thought, and time—are interwoven with it. To understand the Weave is to understand the hidden architecture of the universe. You see now that everything, from the flicker of a candle to the flight of a dragon, is part of this grand tapestry, and you can reshape that design with your will."*

#### **Bonuses from the Revelation:**
- **Reality Shaper**: For the next week, you can cast all spells with either a bonus action or action.
- **Weave Sight**: For 24 hours, you can see the patterns of the Weave as they intersect with reality. You have truesight out to 60 feet and advantage on all Intelligence (Arcana) checks.
- **Existential Mastery**: For the next week, you may alter the physical world with ease. As an action, you can manipulate objects or the environment around you as though you were casting *Control Weather*, *Control Water*, *Control Flames*, or similar spells without expending a spell slot.


*Reading the Nether Scrolls instantly begins a contested skill challenge.*

### Rules 
- Scrolls roll with a +14 to set the DC for each contest 
	- Nat 1's are not failures for the ***Nether Scrolls***
- Player rolls Arcana or Constitution for each contest 
- Player must obtain at least one success in order to not be driven [[long-term-madness|Mad]]
- The party levels up for every success

After the skill challenge is completed successfully, the reader knows the [[Plot of Karthus]] & the history of [Karsus Lore](Karsus Lore).
- Success on 2 or more allows the player to gain a [[Nether Scrolls#5 Chapters|Chapter]] power of their choice.

The unlocking of the Nether Scrolls alerts [Karthus](Karthus) and after the party gains the knowledge they must make a DC 26 Arcana or Constitution save to hang onto the scroll as every character who leveled up suffers the effects of a 9th level [[thunderwave]].

- [[Cult of the Weave Eater]] forces will be dispatched to the location taking (1d4) hours to arrive
- If the party survives they may pick up the scroll and take it with them to make the skill challenge once a week to gain more levels, however each challenge that ends in a success will repeat the [[thunderwave]] and Weave Eater forces being alerted.

## 5 Chapters 
*Each chapter was the length of 10 normal scrolls*
### Arcanus Fundare
The chapter "Foundations of Magic" was about fundamental magic. It gave the reader an instant boost to their spells' effectiveness and magical skill matching and/or surpassing that of true masters, but no additional base magical power.

#### **Mechanics:**
- Your spells automatically deal maximum damage once per long rest.
- You gain advantage on all spell attack rolls and saving throw DCs for 24 hours after reading this chapter.
- Any spell you cast can be cast at 1 spell slot higher than normal without expending an additional slot (up to 9th level).

### Magicus Creare
The chapter "Spells of Creation" was about magic item creation. Reading it provided the user with the ability to create new magic items and the ability to create any magic item with less expenditure of one's essence.

#### **Mechanics:**
- You can create any magic item of **Very Rare** rarity or lower instantly without components or gold **once**. This is a one-time use ability.
- All future magic item crafting requires 75% less time, and the cost is reduced by 50%.
- Once per long rest, you may create any uncommon magic item instantly, with no material costs.
- Any magic item you create is automatically imbued with an additional minor beneficial property (DM’s discretion).

### Maior Creare
The chapter "Major Creation" dealt also with the creation of magic items but with the focus on constructs. It made the reader not only understand how to create constructs but also how to reliably create them at top quality without any fluctuation.

#### **Mechanics:**
- You can create constructs such as golems, homunculi, or other magical beings with significantly reduced material costs (50% less) and time (also reduced by 75%).
- Constructs you create have 25% more hit points, AC +2, and advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.
- You can command any construct you’ve created telepathically, regardless of distance, and they gain intelligence equal to your own (if they were not already intelligent).

### Planus Mechanus
The chapter "Studies of the Planes" dealt with the planes and allowed the reader to use plane shift and not suffer any negative effects from other planes' environments.

#### **Mechanics:**
- You gain the ability to cast *Plane Shift* at will, requiring no material components and no limitations on the number of willing creatures.
- When traveling to another plane, you suffer no environmental or time dilation penalties, and you and your companions always arrive exactly where you intend.
- You can choose one plane of existence; you now have perfect control over the environmental effects and magical laws of this plane (e.g., becoming immune to fire on the Elemental Plane of Fire).

### Ars Factum
The chapter "Of the Creation of Artifacts" had contents that were unknown, though naturally, it was suspected to deal with making artifacts. This chapter's scrolls required some kind of key to be read, but it was never discovered.

#### **Mechanics:**
- You can create **one artifact** of unimaginable power. The DM will work with you to design an artifact-level item, similar to the creation of a Legendary or Mythic item, with powers on par with objects like the *Staff of the Magi* or *The Eye of Vecna*. This is a one-time use ability.
- When wielding or using any artifact you create, you gain advantage on all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks.
- Once per long rest, you may draw upon the power of an artifact you create to cast any 9th level spell (or lower) without expending a spell slot.
