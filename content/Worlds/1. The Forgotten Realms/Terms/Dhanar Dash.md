# **History**
[Dhanar Parhek](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dhanar_Parhek) the final [[Amn|Amnian]] monarch; banned arcane magic in [[Amn]]
- The race is a subtle reference to the dash someone might need to make to avoid prison or death if they are discovered using arcane magic in Amn.
## **Setup:**
1. **Track Layout:**
   - The course consists of **10 segments**. Each segment has an obstacle that players must overcome to move forward.
   - Obstacles will require different ability checks, with a distribution favoring Strength, Constitution, Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma to balance against Dexterity-based characters.

2. **Turn Order:**
   - Determine initiative as normal for the first round.
   - At the end of each round, **initiative order changes** based on player position:
     - The player furthest behind in the race goes first in the next round.
     - The player in the lead goes last.
     - If players are tied, their initiative bonus is the tie breaker

3. **Winning:**
   - The first player to cross the finish line after completing all segments wins the race.

## **Basic Mechanics:**
- **Movement:** 
   - Each turn, players roll a **D20 + Dexterity Modifier** to determine how many segments they move forward.
   - Base movement is 1 segment for a roll of 10, with additional segments for every 5 points above that (e.g., 15 = 2 segments, 20 = 3 segments).

- **Obstacles:**
   - When a player reaches a new segment, they must pass an obstacle to move forward. Failing the check means they don't advance this turn.

     - This action can only be used once per player per race.

### **2. Rally (Bolster Your Effort)**
   - **Description:** Bolster your own spirits and effort through sheer determination or clever strategy.
   - **Mechanics:**
     - Roll a **D20 + Charisma Modifier** against a DC 15.

   - **Description:** Carefully observe the course ahead, planning your moves to land on a more favorable segment.
   - **Mechanics:**
     - Roll a **D20 + Intelligence Modifier** against a DC 14.
     - On a success, you may re-roll your movement dice (D20) and choose which result to use.
     - This action can only be used once per race.
     - On a failure, you must keep your original movement roll.

### **4. Focus (Auto-Succeed on an Obstacle)** 1/Race

   - **Mechanics:**
     - Roll a **D20 + Wisdom Modifier** against a DC 13.
     - On a success, you automatically succeed on the next obstacle check without needing to roll.
     - This action can only be used once per race.
     - On a failure, you face the obstacle normally, but your movement for the turn is reduced by 1 segment.

### **5. Encourage (Help Another Player)**
   - **Description:** Shout words of encouragement or give a tactical tip to help another player.

   - Certain actions can only be used once per race, as noted.
   - Players cannot take the same action on consecutive turns.

## **Power-Ups:**
- **Power-Up Zones:** Place power-ups in specific segments (e.g., segments 3, 6, and 9). When a player lands on a power-up zone, they roll a **D6** to determine the power-up:
   - **1-2:** Speed Boost (+1 segment next turn)
   - **3-4:** Obstacle Bypass (auto-pass the next obstacle)
   - **5-6:** Trap (target a rival; they lose a segment)

## **Catch-Up Mechanics:**
- **Slipstream:** The player in last place can roll an additional **D6** with their movement roll, adding the result to their movement for that turn.

## **Winning the Race:**
- The first player to cross the finish line after overcoming the final obstacle wins.
- The DM can offer small rewards or bonuses to the winner and other participants based on their performance.
