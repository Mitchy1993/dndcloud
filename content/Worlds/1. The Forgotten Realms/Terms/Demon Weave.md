# [[Lolth]]'s Demon Weave

**Summary**: Under Lolth's control, the Weave becomes a chaotic and corruptive force, laced with demonic influence. Spells cast through the Demon Weave are unstable, often twisting into malevolent effects. Lolth's power corrupts magic itself, resulting in unpredictable surges of chaos for spells above 3rd level, while empowering dark enchantments, necromancy, and spider-themed spells.

## General Spellcasting Changes:
- **Light-based Spells**: All spells that generate light (*Light*, *Daylight*, *Faerie Fire*, etc.) are removed from the list of available spells.
- **Healing Spells**: The effects of all healing spells are halved. For example, a spell that would normally heal 20 HP now heals 10 HP.

## Wild Magic Table (For Spells of 4th Level or Higher):
Whenever a caster uses a spell of 4th level or higher, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, the spell triggers a chaotic surge from Lolthâ€™s Demon Weave, causing an additional random effect.

### Demon Weave Chaos Table (1d20):

| **d20 Roll** | **Result**                                                                 |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1            | A swarm of demonic spiders erupts around the caster (within a 10-foot radius) and attacks all creatures (caster included). (Use *Giant Spider* stats, but size is Tiny) |
| 2            | The caster is briefly teleported 30 feet in a random direction.            |
| 3            | The spell summons a random demon (roll on a demon summoning table for CR 1-4 demons), which stays for 1 minute and attacks the nearest creature. |
| 4            | The spell fizzles; the caster takes psychic damage equal to the spell level. |
| 5            | The caster is briefly possessed by a demonic entity, forcing them to attack their nearest ally for 1 round. |
| 6            | The ground within 30 feet of the caster turns to sticky webs (*Web spell* effect) for 1 minute. |
| 7            | The caster sprouts nonfunctional, grotesque spider legs for 1 minute, giving disadvantage on Charisma-based checks during this time. |
| 8            | For the next minute, all spells cast by the caster summon swarms of spiders that crawl out of the ground (no mechanical effect, just a visual). |
| 9            | The spell triggers an explosion of necrotic energy; all creatures within 10 feet take 2d6 necrotic damage. |
| 10-14        | The spell works normally, but the caster's skin temporarily darkens to a drow-like shade for 1 minute. |
| 15           | The caster hears Lolth's voice in their mind, causing them to suffer disadvantage on their next attack roll or ability check. |
| 16           | The spell works, but the caster is frightened by illusory spiders for 1 minute (no save). |
| 17           | For the next minute, all spells the caster casts are accompanied by a high-pitched demonic laughter. |
| 18           | The spell works, but the caster's eyes glow red with demonic energy for 1 minute, causing advantage on Intimidation checks. |
| 19           | The caster can cast the spell without expending a spell slot or material components. |
| 20           | The spell surges with power; its effects are maximized (as if using a 9th-level spell slot). |

## Spell Improvements:
- **Enchantment Spells**: Spells like *Dominate Person*, *Hold Person*, and *Charm Person* have their duration increased by 50%.
- **Necromancy Spells**: Any necromancy spell that deals damage, such as *Inflict Wounds* or *Vampiric Touch*, deals an additional 1d8 poison damage.
- **Conjuration (Summoning Demons)**: Spells like *Summon Lesser Demons* or *Summon Greater Demon* summon one additional demon of the same type for the spell's duration (disadvantage on control checks).
- **Spider-Themed Spells**:
  - *Web*: Covers a 40-foot cube instead of a 20-foot cube.
  - *Spider Climb*: Duration is doubled.
  - *Poison Spray*: Deals an additional 1d6 poison damage.
