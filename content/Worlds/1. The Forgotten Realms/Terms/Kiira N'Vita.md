In the late 14th century DR, the Kiira N'Vita was stolen by a notorious pirate, drawn by tales of the gem's life-giving powers, led a daring raid on the Temple of Dual Echoes. After obtaining the Kiira N'Vita, Jones used its power to enhance his vitality and prolong his life, however stealing the gem triggered a terrible curse that would only be lifted if a sacrifice of gold was offered in the temple ***while holding both sister gems***.

The Kiira N'Vaelahr remained in the temple for a few more years before it, too, was stolen under mysterious circumstances.
