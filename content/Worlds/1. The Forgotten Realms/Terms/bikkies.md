A term commonly used by Ilmatari to refer to "biscuits"

### Etymology
The use of "***bikkie***" is believed to have originated from the [[Ilmater]] Holy City of [[Calimshan]]

*Legend has it that during a particularly harsh winter, when supplies were scarce and hunger gnawed at the bellies of Calimshan's inhabitants, a wandering baker named Raziya arrived at their gates.* 

*Moved by the plight of the people, Raziya offered her skills and ingredients to create sustenance for all.*

*Using a blend of local grains, honey, and spices, Raziya crafted a simple yet hearty biscuit that warmed the souls of those who partook of it. These biscuits became known as "bikkies," a term derived from the Calishite word "bikka," meaning sustenance or nourishment.*

*Bikkies provide not only physical nourishment, but also a sense of comfort and hope. The word "bikkie" soon spread beyond the walls of Calimshan, becoming synonymous with sustenance, kindness, and the enduring spirit in the southern regions of [[Faerun]]*
