# Monsters and Mayhem - Game Rules

## Objectives
### **Monster Team**
- **Primary Goal**: Carry **both glowing chests** to the finish line, guarded by the adventurers.
- **Alternative Goal**: Defeat all adventurers.

### **Adventurer Team**
- **Primary Goal**: Prevent the monsters from delivering both chests for **10 rounds**.
- **Alternative Goal**: Defeat all monsters.
## Arena Mechanics
### 1. **Healing Chests (Carryable)**
- **Location**: Two glowing chests are placed on opposite sides of the arena.
- **Healing Effect**: A creature can touch one chest **once per match** to heal **3d8 hit points**.
#### Chest Movement Rules
- **Ogres and Trolls**: 
  - Can **pick up** a chest as an action, but their movement speed is reduced by **10 feet** while carrying it.
- **Other creatures**:
  - Can **push or pull** a chest **5 feet as an action** with a successful **DC 14 Strength check**.
#### Winning Condition
- Monsters win by carrying **both chests** to the finish line

### 2. **Mimic Perimeter Trap**
- **Location**: The arena’s perimeter is covered with gold and mimic chests, treated as **rough terrain**.
#### Trap Effect
- Any creature stepping onto the gold must make a **DC 14 Acrobatics or Athletics check** to avoid being restrained by a mimic’s tongue.
- A **restrained** creature can attempt to break free at the start of their turn with the same check.
#### **Focused Restraint Rule**
- **If a creature is restrained by a mimic**, other creatures can move freely through that area **without making a check**.
- Once the restrained creature breaks free, the area becomes dangerous again.

### 3. **Burning Statues (Hazard)**
- **Location**: Two large statues are in the center of the arena, facing away from each other.
#### Hazard Effect
- Any creature that moves or is moved within **5 feet of the statues** takes **2d10 fire damage** per turn

### 4. **Collapsing Floor Panels**
- The arena is made up of **5x5 foot zones**.
#### Movement and Collapse
- **Tile Collapse Timing**: 
  - When a player moves their creature, they **draw a colored line** along the path their creature took during their turn.
  - These tiles remain intact until the **end of the creature’s next turn**.
  - At the end of that creature’s **next turn**, the tiles along that path **collapse**.
#### Collapse Effect
- Creatures still standing on collapsing tiles must succeed on a **DC 15 Dexterity saving throw** or fall into a pit, taking **2d6 bludgeoning damage** and being moved to the nearest stable tile
#### **Wyrmling Special Rule**
- **Wyrmlings** hover above the tiles and **do not trigger them** to collapse. This allows wyrmlings to move freely without causing floor panels to drop.

### 5. **Rock Mounds (Ranged Character Advantage)**
- **Location**: Several **10-foot-high rock mounds** are scattered around the arena.
#### Climbing and Advantage
- **Acrobatics Check**: Ranged characters can attempt to climb a rock mound by passing a **DC 15 Acrobatics check** as part of their movement.
  - **Success**: The character gains **Advantage** on all ranged attack rolls while on the mound.
  - **Failure**: The character remains on the ground.
#### Exiting the Mound
- A creature can safely climb down using normal movement, or **jump off** with a **DC 10 Acrobatics check** to avoid fall damage.
  - **Failure** when jumping results in **1d6 bludgeoning damage** from the fall.

## Monster Abilities

### 1. **Wyrmling**: 
- **Hovering**: Wyrmlings hover above the tiles and **do not trigger them to collapse**. They can move freely across the arena without worrying about falling tiles.
- **Fire Breath (Once per match)**: As an action, the wyrmling can use a **breath weapon** attack in a **15-foot cone**, dealing **2d6 fire damage** on a **failed DC 13 Dexterity save** (half damage on a success).

### 2. **Ogre**: 
- **Brute Strength**: Ogres can make a **Shove action** as a bonus action. This allows them to push enemies into hazards (e.g., mimics, collapsing tiles, or burning statues).
- **Chest Throw (Once per match)**: As an action, an ogre carrying a chest can **throw it up to 10 feet**. The chest will land and remain intact where it lands. This provides a tactical option for closing the gap between the chest and the finish line.

### 3. **Troll**: 
- **Regeneration**: At the start of each of the troll's turns, it regains **5 hit points** unless it has taken fire or acid damage.
- **Overpowering Leap (Once per match)**: As a bonus action, the troll can **leap up to 15 feet** in any direction, ignoring terrain effects. If it lands on an enemy, that creature must make a **DC 14 Strength save** or be knocked prone.

### 4. **Goblin**: 
- **Nimble Escape**: Goblins can take the **Disengage** or **Hide** action as a bonus action, allowing them to quickly move in and out of combat.
- **Saboteur (Once per match)**: As an action, the goblin can set a **trap** on any tile within 5 feet of it. If any creature (friend or foe) steps on that tile, it triggers, dealing **1d6 piercing damage** and reducing their movement speed by 10 feet for one turn.
## Win Conditions
### **Monster Team**
1. **Primary Goal**: Carry both glowing healing chests to the finish line.
2. **Alternative Goal**: Defeat all adventurers.
### **Adventurer Team**
1. **Primary Goal**: Prevent the monsters from delivering both chests for **10 rounds**.
2. **Alternative Goal**: Defeat all monsters.
## Additional Mechanics
### 1. **Pitfall Damage**
- Creatures that fall into a pit take **2d6 bludgeoning damage** and are moved to the nearest stable tile.

### 2. **Pushing and Forced Movement**
- Abilities that cause forced movement (e.g., shove attacks, spells) can push creatures into hazards:
  - **Collapsing tiles**.
  - **Burning statue aura**.
  - **Mimic perimeter**.

## Strategy Tips
- **Monsters**: 
  - Use your unique abilities to outmaneuver the adventurers. The **wyrmling** can hover and scout without triggering tiles, **ogres** can shove enemies into hazards, **trolls** can tank hits while regenerating health, and **goblins** can sabotage or escape tricky situations.
- **Adventurers**: 
  - Use the **rock mounds** to gain Advantage on ranged attacks, and prioritize pushing monsters into hazards like collapsing tiles, fire, or mimics.

## Clarifications
### **Collapsing Tiles Timing**
- Tiles collapse at the **end of a creature’s next turn**, not immediately after movement. This allows players a full turn to adjust their position and avoid the pitfalls.

### **Mimic Perimeter Trap**
- If a creature is **restrained** by a mimic, others can move freely through that space **without triggering the trap**. Once the restrained creature breaks free, the area becomes dangerous again.

### **Monster Unique Abilities**
- Each monster has its own unique ability (see above) that adds tactical variety and strategic advantages during the match.
