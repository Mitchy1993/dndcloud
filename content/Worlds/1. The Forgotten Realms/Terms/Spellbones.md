Human finger sized, translucent gray-white clay hued porcelain batons that contain a spell.

Chiefly produced in [[Imberler]], where they are called Daarra. They are sold in wooden boxes with the spell name on them, however those carrying many spell bones of the same kind will hollow out a long bone and fill the inside of it with individually cloth wrapped Daarra.

All-in-all Spellbones are very similar to spell scrolls except they can be used easily by anyone, spellcaster or not. 

Sold and found in the underdark, primarily produced in Imberler.

### Most Common Spells in Spellbones:
-  Bless
- Cure Wounds
- Feather Fall
- Magic Missile
- Mending

Often not beyond a 5th-level spell contained in a spell bone, although there is no upper limit.
