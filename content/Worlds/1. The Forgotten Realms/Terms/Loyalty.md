| 1d10 | Major    | ± 1-10 points  |

### **Loyalty Tiers**

| Loyalty Score | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **21**        | The NPC is completely devoted and will sacrifice anything for the player characters (PCs). |
| **10-20**     | The NPC is loyal and willing to fight alongside and for the PCs. |
| **1-9**       | The NPC is friendly and helpful, but loyalty is not yet solidified. |
| **0**         | The NPC is neutral, neither loyal nor disloyal. |
| **-1 to -4**  | The NPC is untrustworthy and may be easily swayed or bribed to leave or betray the PCs. |
| **-5**        | The NPC actively seeks to impede or harm the PCs. |

### **Loyalty Adjustments**

#### Positive Actions:
- **Minor Favor**: Roll a `1d4` and increase the NPC's loyalty by the result.
  - Examples: Giving the NPC a small gift, completing a minor quest, or providing useful information.
  
- **Major Favor**: Roll a `1d10` and increase the NPC's loyalty by the result.
  - Examples: Saving the NPC’s life, fulfilling a personal goal, or granting a significant reward.

#### Negative Actions:
- **Minor Offense**: Roll a `1d4` and decrease the NPC's loyalty by the result.
  - Examples: Insulting the NPC, refusing a request, or damaging their property.
  
- **Major Offense**: Roll a `1d10` and decrease the NPC's loyalty by the result.
  - Examples: Betraying the NPC, harming their loved ones, or directly opposing their goals.

### **Special Events**

Occasionally, extreme actions or pivotal moments may allow for direct manipulation of loyalty without rolling. These events could shift loyalty by a fixed amount (e.g., +5 or -5) based on their importance to the NPC.

### **Example Use**

- If the players help the NPC find a missing family member (major favor), roll `1d10` and increase their loyalty by the result.
- If the players accidentally destroy the NPC's shop in a fire (major offense), roll `1d10` and decrease their loyalty accordingly.
