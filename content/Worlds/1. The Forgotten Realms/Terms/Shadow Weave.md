# [[Shar]]'s Shadow Weave

**Summary**: The Shadow Weave, under Sharâ€™s control, is a dark and subtle force that draws on shadows and entropy. It distorts magic into something cold, draining, and despairing. Spells cast through the Shadow Weave are empowered in ways that reflect Shar's domain of darkness, with a focus on illusions, necromancy, and shadow-themed spells, while healing and light-based magic is diminished.

## General Spellcasting Changes:
- **Light-based Spells**: All spells that generate light (*Light*, *Daylight*, *Faerie Fire*, etc.) are removed from the list of available spells.
- **Healing Spells**: The effects of all healing spells are halved. For example, a spell that would normally heal 20 HP now heals 10 HP.

## Spell Improvements:

- **Illusion Spells**: Spells from the Illusion school (like *Invisibility*, *Mirror Image*, *Greater Invisibility*) are harder to detect or dispel. Any check to see through an illusion or dispel it is made with disadvantage. Additionally, illusion spells last 50% longer.
  
- **Necromancy Spells**: Necromancy spells that deal damage (like *Blight* or *Chill Touch*) deal an additional 1d8 necrotic damage and impose a debuff:
  - *Blight*: The target's speed is reduced by 10 feet for 1 minute.
  - *Chill Touch*: The target has disadvantage on its next attack roll.

- **Enchantment Spells**: Spells like *Fear* and *Crown of Madness* cause the target to have disadvantage on their initial saving throw to resist the spell.

- **Shadow-Themed Spells**:
  - *Darkness*: Cannot be dispelled by magical light and its radius is increased by 10 feet.
  - *Shadow Blade*: Deals an additional 1d6 psychic damage on a hit.
  - *Misty Step*: When used in dark or shadowy areas, the caster can teleport an additional 10 feet.
