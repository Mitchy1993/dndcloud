One round of Blackjack hosted by an illusory Goblin.
- Win or lose you will always fight [[Cardshark.gif|Cardshark]] and need to kill it to win.

*"Win or lose it matters not, house always wins in case you forgot...*

### Blackjack Rules *Converted to Dice*
1. Each player puts a 10gp ante in the pot.
2. Each player rolls 3d6. Play then proceeds clockwise around the table, with the host of the game going last.
3. On their turn, a player can choose to "stand" or "roll 1d6." If the player stands, the next player can take a turn. A player who rolls takes an additional die and rolls it. If the total of their dice exceeds 21, they "***break***" and are out of the game. Otherwise, they can keep rolling additional dice until they either ***stand*** or ***break***.
	1. Once a player "***stands***," they can no longer "***roll***"
4. After everyone has either "***breaks***" or is "standing", the highest point total (excluding players who ***broke***) wins the game and takes the pot.

### Payout Before Fighting Cardshark
- Winner gains 1d4 x 10 gp from house.
- If house wins it keeps the ante.
