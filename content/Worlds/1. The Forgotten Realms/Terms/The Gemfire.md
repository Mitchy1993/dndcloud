![[The Gemfire.png]]
Captain [[Tommy Jones]] and First Mate [[Alenia Jones]] command their ship with iron fists. Revered and feared by many. 

- The Gemfire's favorite port is [[Waterdeep]], and they never commit open piracy against this port or the city itself.
- The crew are avid frequenters of the [[Yawning Portal]]. 
- Goodie-two-shoes have tried to speak out against the pirates, but those who do usually disappear within days... dead men tell no tales.
- The ship has some slaves on board, including [[Turak]] a loyal slave of [[Alenia Jones]]
	- Slave Quartermaster: [[Octavius]]
