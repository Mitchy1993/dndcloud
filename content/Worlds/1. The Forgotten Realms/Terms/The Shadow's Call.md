![[The Shadow's Call.png|500]]
*When stars align and shadows fall,*
*The old Weave's thread begins to stall*.
*In darkness deep, a whisper's thrall,*
***[[The One in stone]]**, begins the call.*

---

*So heroes rise with hearts of light,*
*To pierce the gloom, to end the plight.*
*Seek **[[ancient lore]]**, by **[moon]**'s own sight,*
*And obtain the key to break the night.*

---
*Read his [Folly], become the quill*
*Finish the story, of **[[Netheril]]***

### **When Read at Night Under Full Moon**
- Visage of [[Selune]] Appears & pleads w/ reader that her daughter [[Mystra]] is in trouble
- *Amidst the trees, forever stood*
	*Karsus fell, to the Dire Wood*
	*Find him there, pay the toll*
	*A trade for trade, Scroll for [Scrolls]*
