A condition in which the [[Arcanocytes]] of a creature lose their ability to commune with [[Mystra]]'s [[Weave]]

There is currently no known cure for this condition.

Most die immediately upon being Spellbroken, although some have simply suffered a range of severe disabilities. ***(Roll Death Saving Throws w/ Disadvantage to survive with disabilities)***

The consistent outcome between all who share this condition is that they lose the ability to cast magic using Mystra's Weave.
