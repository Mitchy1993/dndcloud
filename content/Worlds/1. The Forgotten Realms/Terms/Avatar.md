# Overview

Creating an Avatar is an extraordinary event in which a deity can directly manifest itself into the material realm once every 50 years.

## Power Sacrifice

- A portion of the God's/Goddess's power is invested into the Avatar, with the remainder held in stasis by AO.
- This sacrifice provides the deity with an exceptionally powerful agent capable of executing their will with nearly divine authority and influence, even in realms where divine presence is restricted.

## Immortal Nature

- Avatars are effectively immortal, possessing incredible regenerative abilities and resilience. They do not age in a conventional sense.
- In the event of physical destruction. They will eventually regenerate or be reconstituted by their deity in the next 50 years
- Avatars wield extraordinary powers that surpass those of Chosen. They are capable of performing miracles, altering reality on a significant scale, and influencing large events directly.
## Restrictions and Costs

- Creating an Avatar is a rare and costly process. The deity must carefully consider the need and implications, as the creation of an Avatar significantly diminishes their own power and influence.
- When other gods notice an Avatar has manifested on the material plane, the power-hungry among them often move to destroy the temporarily weakened God. This means the use of an Avatar must be for a very specific and quickly achievable purpose, as it provides a vulnerable window for a God/Goddess to be overpowered.
