An 12th-level spell which altered the disposition of reality

Karsus believed the spell was capable of allowing it's user to become a god of their choosing, replacing a current god with themselves. 

In truth, the spell could steal the **power** of a chosen god, but not the **divinity** of their domain. Only AO himself can recognize and approve a domain shift unless a God is outright slain, in which case AO would still have to recognize their replacement (*usually the slayer*).
