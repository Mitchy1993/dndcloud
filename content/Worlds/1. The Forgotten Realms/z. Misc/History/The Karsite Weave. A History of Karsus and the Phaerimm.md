# The [[Karsite Weave]]: A History of [[Karsus]] and the Phaerimm

## Discovery of the Phaerimm's Nature

In this version of history, Karsus’ pursuit of power and his eventual downfall began not merely with desperation, but with an intense desire to understand his enemies, the **phaerimm**. Early in the conflict, Karsus captured several dead phaerimm and began to study their bodies in hopes of finding a way to defeat them.

Through extensive research and experimentation, Karsus discovered that the phaerimm were not simply "draining" magic through their **Lifedrain** spells. Rather, they were **changing** the very nature of the magic they interacted with. Karsus found that something intrinsic to the phaerimm’s biology was violently interacting with the magic that flowed abundantly through the world, disrupting it at a fundamental level.

## The Discovery of Arcanocytes

Karsus had long known of the existence of **arcanocytes**—microscopic, symbiotic entities present in all living creatures, plants, and the natural world. These cells were crucial to life on Toril, as they served as the link between living beings and the **Weave** of magic. Without arcanocytes, creatures would be unable to access the magic flowing through the world, and life as known would not exist.

However, through his studies, Karsus discovered that the phaerimm were unique: **they had no arcanocytes**. In fact, the presence of living phaerimm in any area caused nearby arcanocytes to violently **lyse** (break down). This explained why the phaerimm were so destructive to both life and magic—they were fundamentally incompatible with the magic of the Weave itself.

## Ancient Origins of the Phaerimm’s Power

Karsus' research led him to an even more ancient truth: the origin of the phaerimm's power dated back to the conflict between **Shar** and **Selûne**, the cosmic struggle that birthed **Mystryl** (the precursor to Mystra) and eventually led to the creation of life on Toril.

During the formative stages of creation, Mystryl imbued the newly formed world with the **Weave**, and in doing so, infused all living things with arcanocytes. However, Shar—out of pure spite—**shielded the phaerimm** from receiving arcanocytes. Instead, she gave them symbiotic cells that connected directly to **pure, unfiltered divine magic**, bypassing the Weave entirely.

### The Phaerimm’s Destructive Influence

While Mystryl's Weave filters divine magic into a form that is safe for mortal use, the phaerimm's ability to connect to **raw divine magic** was inherently destructive. When this pure magic entered the world, it reacted violently with Mystryl’s Weave, unraveling and destroying it. This explained the phaerimm's destructive power and their ability to "drain" life and magic from their surroundings.

## The Creation of the Karsite Weave

Armed with this knowledge, Karsus was determined to master the phaerimm's power. Over time, he developed a method of harnessing raw, unfiltered magic similar to the phaerimm’s ability, and he called this creation **The [[Karsite Weave]]**. Unlike Mystryl’s Weave, which filtered and structured magic for safe use, the Karsite Weave allowed its wielder to tap into pure, unfiltered magic—magic with the same **destructive properties** when brought into contact with the traditional Weave.

Unfortunately, Karsus was never able to perfect or stabilize the Karsite Weave. He was still in the process of refining it when he cast **[[Karsus' Avatar]]**, which led to his death, the collapse of Netheril, and the failure of his experiments.

## Legacy of the Karsite Weave

Though Karsus perished before completing the Karsite Weave, his research and the prototype Weave were preserved. The Karsite Weave was sealed within a powerful magical orb, lying dormant for many centuries. It wasn’t until the **15th century DR** that the Karsite Weave was rediscovered by the wizard **[[Gale Dekarios]]**, who in an effort to impress [[Mystra]], absorbed the orb into his body by mistake draining all of his vast power and nearly killing him.
