### DC 10: Basic Knowledge
- **[[Karsus]] was one of the most powerful archwizards of the ancient Netherese Empire.**
- He sought to save his people from a great threat (the **phaerimm**) by gaining more power than any mortal should wield.
- Karsus’ attempt to steal the power of the goddess of magic led to the **fall of [[Netheril]]**, and the collapse of its floating cities in -339DR.

### DC 15: Deeper Historical Insight
- Karsus experimented on **phaerimm corpses** in an attempt to understand their magic-draining powers. He believed that unlocking their secrets could help him defeat them.
- Karsus discovered that the phaerimm didn’t just drain magic—they somehow altered it, causing great disruption in areas where they lived.
- Karsus theorized that something intrinsic to the phaerimm's **biology** was interacting violently with the Weave itself.

### DC 20: Hidden Research and Mystical Biology
- Karsus uncovered the existence of **arcanocytes**—microscopic entities that allow all living things to connect to the Weave. These are crucial for life and the ability to wield magic.
- He found that phaerimm **lack arcanocytes**, and their presence causes these cells to break down in living creatures, contributing to their destructive nature.
- Through his research, Karsus traced the phaerimm's powers back to a **cosmic conflict** between Shar and Selûne. Shar shielded the phaerimm from arcanocytes and connected them directly to **pure divine magic**, making them a threat to the stability of the Weave itself.

### DC 25: Ultimate Secret - [[The Karsite Weave. A History of Karsus and the Phaerimm|The Karsite Weave]]
- Before his downfall, Karsus began to experiment with a form of magic similar to that of the phaerimm—an unfiltered, raw type of magic he dubbed the **Karsite Weave**.
- Unlike Mystra’s Weave, the Karsite Weave allowed direct access to **pure magic**, without the safeguards of the Weave. This made it extremely dangerous, as it had the potential to unravel magic in the same way the phaerimm's powers did.
- Karsus never finished stabilizing the Karsite Weave, but his unfinished work was sealed in a powerful **orb** before Netheril’s fall. The orb containing this forbidden magic lay dormant for centuries until it was rediscovered by the wizard **Gale Dekarios** in the 15th century DR.
