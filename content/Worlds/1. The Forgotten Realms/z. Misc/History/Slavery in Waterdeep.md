# Slavery in Waterdeep

## Summary
Slavery is officially illegal in [[Waterdeep]], but an exception exists for criminals subjected to **[[Cerebral Cleansing]]**. These individuals, called **[[Obedient Servant]]s**, are sold as property for labor. While the system is tightly controlled, an illegal **black market** for non-mind-wiped slaves thrives among the wealthy.

## Key Points
- **Legal Slavery**: Only criminals convicted of severe crimes (e.g., murder, treason) undergo Cerebral Cleansing, which erases their memory and will, turning them into **Obedient Servants**.
  - **Obedience Collars**: Magical devices ensure their compliance.
  - **Labor**: Sold to nobles, temples, and guilds for menial tasks.
  - **Limited Supply**: Few criminals qualify, creating high demand.

- **Black Market**: Illegally trafficked slaves (not mind-wiped) are secretly bought by the wealthy.
  - **Secretive**: Authorities struggle to stop this due to the market's profitability.

- **Ethical Debate**: Some (good-aligned temples, activists) view Cerebral Cleansing as immoral, stripping individuals of their rights. Others argue it's a necessary punishment for dangerous criminals.

- **Corruption**: Wealthy nobles often manipulate or bypass the law, acquiring illegal slaves with few consequences.
