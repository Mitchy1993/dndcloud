  Percival Tymz, born of a union between a human and a vampire, has always existed on the fringes of society. Raised in the shadowy underbelly of a bustling metropolis, he learned early on the art of survival through deception and manipulation. 
  
  As he matured, Percival realized the potential power that lay within the intricate web of politics, and set his sights on ascending to a position of influence within the city. Embracing his Dhampir heritage, he mastered the arts of espionage and subterfuge; Percival genuinely believes that he can make the city a better place, but he understands that to combat the entrenched evils that plague it, he must sometimes resort to unsavory tactics. He sees himself as a *necessary evil*, using his cunning and wit to beat evil at its own game in order to enact real change.

Here, Percival gathers vast amounts of information from the loose lips of patrons, ensuring that he stays one step ahead in his quest to rid the city of corruption and injustice.
