![[Abyssal Summon.jpg]]
![[Dretch.png|250]] ------------------------------![[Dretch.png|250]] 
### Aerial Dominance
- ![[Spectrum vs Silas.png|500]]
- Spectrum challenges [[Silas Woodsman.jpg|Silas]] to a race through the trees of the [[Dreaded Wood.jpg|Dreaded Wood]] to start off the adventure! 
### Eat Your Veggies or They'll Eat You
- ![[Plant Monsters.png|500]]
- The party comes across a badly wounded Dire Wolf
- [[Seraph Solaris.jpeg|Seraph]] heals it 
	- Meanwhile [[Logan Blackwood]] smells a strong waft of **DANISHES** and is forced to follow his one true love!
		- Sorrel tries to guide him back, but Logan is quickly snatched away by one of the plant monsters and Sorrel is horribly disfigured, with a NAT 20 acid blast to the face.
- The party scrambles to defeat the monsters, with Logan nearly losing his life to yet another trick of the mind.
### Where's Walter 
- With the plants defeated, Walter spills out onto the floor dead.
	- Sorrel casts healing word on him and resurrects him with the blessing of Maldive!
	- [[Gorthul.png|Gorthul]], the ever opportunist, takes advantage of Seraph witnessing another non-religious individual receive impossibly high levels of divine favor and fuels a hateful jealousy to the point of an internal faith crisis.
	- Spectrum dutifully corrects Seraph's thinking and helps him battle Gorthul with a NAT 20 persuasion check.
- The group presses onwards to reach the center of the Dreaded Wood

### When Learning Abyssal Pays Off
- Silas discovers a [[Abyssal Summon.jpg|terrible creature]] and two [[dretch.png|dretchs]] guarding a summoning circle 
- The party ambushes them and [[Sorrel.jpg|Sorrel]] is able to speak with the abyssal creature 
	- *"Your world will burn in the fires of the abyss. Elturel will rise again"*
	- *"Capturing souls for freedom "*
	- *"It's eaten many children before and none have escaped it"*

### When Learning Abyssal Doesn't Mean Your Not In Danger 
The Abyssal creature absolutely wipes the floor with the party...
- Spectrum's material form is destroyed
- Silas and Ewan fight for their friends, trying desperately to hold off the creature! 
- The creature intelligently focuses it's maelstrom of blows on destroying the sources of shielding damage for the party Sorrel & Logan.
- Logan & Walter begin to destroy the Runic Summoning Circle with great success, but in doing so they release wave after wave of arcanic wild magic surges in all directions!!
- Logan grits his teeth for the task at hand and brings the Circle to the verge of collapse, but is suddenly dealt an overwhelming amount of damage before he can deliver the finishing strike, leaving the final blow to Seraph...
- The Abyssal nightmare surges towards Seraph and trades verbal blows with him, but it's attacks miss and swing wildly into Seraphs rapidly shifting [[Mirror Image.png|illusions]]
	- Seraph charges an eldritch blast to finish off the circle!! and.............
- ***SUCCESS!!!!!!!!!!!!***..... right??

### WRONG: Enter Gorthul!!
![[Gorthul.png]]
- As the Circle breaks and the creature is vacuumed back into the Abyss from whence it came; the creature lashes out in one final defiant attack as its tentacles lethally slash Seraph across the head.
	- Seraph staggers and calls for [[Spectrum (Light).jpg|Spectrum's]] help, but Spectrum is no more. 
	- Gorthul bursts forth from within Seraph and to the dismay of Silas... an Abyssal monster stands in the Dreaded Woods once more

### Oprah Style Death Saving Throws 
As Gorthul steps into the world for the first time in a decade he surveys the area, he contemplates the benefits of returning to home sweet home in the Abyss , but upon seeing the Runic Circle destroyed he takes the only option remaining and turns his attention to Silas and Ewan...

Logan, Seraph, and Sorrel roll death saving throws together in the deep inky blackness of the [[Dreaded Wood.jpg|Dreaded Wood]].
#### Logan 
3-2 ***Success***!!
#### Seraph
3-2 ***Success!!***
#### Sorrel
***CRIT MISS FAILURE***!!!!... Sorrel of Vesper Falls draws his final breath.......

...BUT BY THE GRACE OF MALDIVE HERSELF!!! HE LIIIIVVESSS!!!!!!

***CRITICAL SUCCESS via Lucky Feat NAT 20 BABY!!!***

Sorrel's token of Maldive ignites a brilliant glow and gives him one more shot at protecting his friends!! **LET'S FREAKING GOOO!!!!**

### The Longest Rest
The party collapses for the night with Logan & Seraph rendered forcibly unconscious, leaving Sorrel & Silas as the only one's left standing. Eternal rest was narrowly avoided today by our intrepid heroes, but whos to say for how long...
- ![[Seraph & Logan Unconcious.png|500]]
- The party will grow more powerful from their victory, assuming they see the rising sun.
- Silas and Sorrel find Mikkel's Signet ring at the Summoning Circle

What are the implications of the ring? What is the true fate of Wyatt? ***Could the Danishes have been real***?? 

## FIND OUT NEXT TIME!!!
