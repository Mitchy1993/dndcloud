	- Further solidifies that Lycan battles the forces of evil and Seraph feels like an a-hole.
- Princess Sorrel sleeps off his exhaustion after casting one spell and enduring the strain of being driven around on Silas' back.
### [[Lycan]]s-Therapy
Silas begins an existential breakthrough as he realizes that the deities have real power that can help. He askes Sorrel and Seraph how one draws close to a deity.

Seraph and Sorrel explain that it is not that different from the way he immerses himself in nature. It's a matter of redirecting that devotion and synchronizing with the elements of the deity in the same way Silas strives to do with nature.

Seraph presses the medallion of Lycan into Silas's palm and in a sincere gesture of encouragement. 

Silas puts faith in Lycan while holding Wyatt's medallion and after reaching a point of no return within himself and choosing to press forward an incredible manifestation of Lycan appears before him.

Lycan admits knowing Wyatt by name and tells Silas that "they" have taken Wyatt. He posed the question: what are you willing to do to find Wyatt?

Silas *pledges* himself to Lycan. This comes with a few rules:

#### **Become the Monster**
- Respect Lycan.
- Do not cause more havoc than you need to .
- Use gifts bestowed to be a monster, an aberration, to be different and go against the grain.
- Lycan's children are those that do not fit in anywhere.

Reward: Silas can wild shape into a talking hippogriff.
