*"To whomever finds this note"*

*Our journey began with a promise of fortune, but we have found only despair. Our vessel, the Wanderer's Resolve, sailed from distant shores, seeking the legendary Isle. The stars guided us, yet fate betrayed us.*

*Three nights past, a storm unlike any other bore down upon us. The winds howled with the fury of a thousand souls, and the sea rose to claim us. In the heart of the tempest, a rift opened in the skyâ€”a shimmering tear in the fabric of our world. The storm swallowed us whole, and when it abated, we were marooned here, far from any sea.*

*Madness has overtaken my crew, I've barricaded myself in these quarters...*

*If you find this, know that the rift still lingers. It is a portal to realms unknown, a gateway to peril and wonder. Beware the call of the storm and the secrets it holds.*

*In my final moments, I clutch this truth: we were but pawns in a greater game, drawn by forces beyond our understanding. Seek the Isle if you dare, but be prepared to face the same fate.*

*May the gods watch over you,*

*Captain Aric Stormrider*
