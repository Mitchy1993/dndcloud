## Clues
*It is happening again. I keep seeing them everywhere I go. I can hear them outside my window even now.*

*I tried to talk to the guys about it, but I do not think they want to hear it. I know they think I am crazy. I do not blame them; if I was them, I would think I was crazy. Who knows, maybe I am crazy.*

*I feel like I'm starting to lose it. No, I know I am not crazy. Something has been following me. I can hear footsteps behind me when I walk. I hear voices calling my name. Something is jiggling the lock on the door. I can hear it scratching at the window. I can feel its eyes upon me as it watches me hungrily from the foot of my bed.*

*I know I am safe here, at least for now. Safe under the covers, clutching my pendant. Lycan will keep me safe. I know he will. I pray sleep takes me soon.*

## History
## The Tragic Bond: The Loss of Wyatt

### Early Life

Wyatt's story began on a cold, rainy night. The howling wind and relentless rain set a somber tone as he was left at the orphanage as an infant. The caregivers, moved by the infant's plight, took him in, offering a chance at a better life. For the first few years, Wyatt thrived. He showed no signs of neurodivergence, socialized well with other children, and met all the learning benchmarks for his age. Bright and curious, he was full of energy and imagination.

### Adoption by the Leto Family

At age five, Wyatt's life took a dramatic turn. He was adopted by the Leto family, a decision that initially seemed like a blessing. [[Mikkel Leto]] and [[Lilia Leto]] Leto had recently moved into town. [[Mikkel Leto]], busy with city council work, left [[Lilia Leto]] alone and yearning for company. The adoption seemed to solve her loneliness.

But the motivations behind the adoption were murky. Was it a whim to satisfy [[Lilia Leto]]’s need for companionship? Or a poorly judged decision, overlooking [[Lilia Leto]]’s capabilities as a mother? The answers remain shrouded in mystery. What is certain is that one morning, a few months later, Wyatt was returned to the orphanage, the very place he'd been abandoned as an infant. He was left with only the clothes on his back and a medallion bearing the symbol of the God Lykan.

The Letos vanished from the city, leaving no trace behind. The medallion's dark, swirling symbol seemed to whisper secrets that no one could decipher.

### Post-Adoption Struggles

The day Wyatt returned he was a changed boy, his once bright eyes now seemed haunted. He was less social, prone to dramatic fits, and showed no interest in activities he once loved. Hide-and-seek, playing with friends, and creative pursuits no longer brought him joy. He seemed lost, a shadow of the vibrant child he once was.

It was about supper time when a slightly older boy named Sorrel, feeling pity for Wyatt's sad state, came over, sat next to a depressed Wyatt sitting on the floor against a wall and said, "*Hey bud... is this spot taken*?" Wyatt didn't reply. Sitting down anyway, the boy continued, "That's a *nice medallion you got there, where'd you get it*?"

Wyatt muttered, "It keeps the shadows away," his fingers tracing its intricate designs.

Sorrel looked from the medallion to the boy, and he continued, "*Hey so I think it's pretty sucky what those guys did droppin you back off, but like... who needs 'em am I right*?"

No reply from Wyatt... Sorrel sat there for a minute racking his mind for the right thing to say.

Finally, after what seemed like eons, Sorrel took a leap of faith, and put his arm around Wyatt, drawing him into his side to hold him there...

Wyatt broke down into cathartic tears of pure release.

The two boys stayed just like that well into the night, until they both fell asleep.

### Friendship and Adventures

From that day onwards, Wyatt was inseparable from Sorrel. This companionship pulled Wyatt from his emotional abyss. Wyatt clung to Sorrel, following him everywhere. Though his social skills never fully recovered, this friendship provided the shelter Wyatt needed to once again begin interacting with his environment. In the coming days, Sorrel introduced Wyatt to his core friend group: Logan, Silas, and Seraph, all of them embarking on countless escapades around town.

Sorrel and Wyatt snuck into the market to taste fresh fruits and sweet pastries, their pockets filled with pilfered treats. Logan & Wyatt explored the dense woods at the edge of town, imagining themselves as daring adventurers saving the world from colossal monsters and evil forces! For Silas and Wyatt, the woods became their imaginary kingdom called Chauntea, filled with imaginary animal followers, enchanted groves, and natural wonders.

They loved playing at Lake Deepwater, sometimes daring each other to run inside the Enchanted Forest during the day, although even they were smart enough to never go near it at night. Other days they would terrorize the town with pranks, often ending the day by clambering across the neighboring rooftops to watch the sunset; Seraph would unfailingly drone on about the wonders of ***Lumen*** and how the light within can overcome any evil in this world *(always met with eye rolls and "Here we go again" from the gang)*.

Wyatt, Logan, Seraph, Sorrel, and Silas attended the local school where Elowen, Seraph's mother, taught social studies. Her lectures were detailed and monotonous, much like Seraph's droning's about Lumen. The children often exchanged funny faces & weary glances, yet enduring these classes bonded them further. These were the days Wyatt felt most alive, his laughter echoing throughout the city.

Only the most astute would notice that during this time, Wyatt was ***rarely seen with his medallion***, as it rested tucked away in a drawer. Although at night he was more skittish than others, his spirit was fortified in the presence of his friends.

### Adolescence

For years, it seemed that Wyatt’s social regression had completely halted. The boys were thick as thieves and they'd even adopted a solemn life pact that, no matter what, they would gather each year to be together on the anniversary of Wyatt's return to the orphanage to commemorate Wyatt and the unbreakable bond they shared.

However, as Wyatt reached late adolescence, a new challenge emerged. His closest friends—Logan, Seraph, Sorrel, and Silas—all a few years older than him, reached adulthood before him, and the time they shared together suddenly decreased dramatically. The older boys began focusing on expanding their skillsets, pursuing their aspirations, Logan & Silas even venturing abroad. All of them, in their own ways, were leaving Wyatt somewhat behind.

This impending separation hit Wyatt hard. He reverted to old habits, losing interest in normal activities. The medallion returned, and he became increasingly fascinated with Lykan, the God of Monsters. This obsession grew. Perhaps it fortified him, perhaps it protected him, or perhaps the idea of serving a deity who controlled the monsters he thought he'd seen gave him solace—a way to feel protected as his friends drifted away.

### Disappearance

A few years passed, and after Wyatt’s friends finished their preliminary training, they reunited for their annual tradition at the local tavern, The Rusty Flagon. After several drinks, revelries, and storytelling, Wyatt got up to use the bathroom and was gone for a bit.

The companions chattered about this and that until Silas inquired, "*How long do you think until Wyatt starts doing something with his life? There's a whole world of nature out there*!" Sorrel said, "*Yea, he's been having a tough time here I've noticed*." Seraph expanded on the point, *"Guys, Wyatt isn't like us, he's not strong, he can't do the things we can do. I don't see a day where he's ever able to live life without someone watching over him."*

It was at this moment that Wyatt returned from the bathroom just in time to hear everything.

Wyatt seemed broken by their lack of faith in him, he begged, *"I'm not weak, I'm just scared."*

Silas began to lay into Wyatt, *"It's okay to be scared, but in nature those who run do so because they are prey, you and Sorrel come from the same place, if he can be strong so can you."*

Wyatt produced the black and gold medallion, *"This can stop them, I can be strong with this."*

Bewildered, his friends demanded that Wyatt explain himself. But Seraph, a warlock blessed by the God Lumen, recognized the symbol immediately. With righteous indignation, he roared at Wyatt, *"That vile and reproachable idol should be cast aside, to put your faith in it is the mark of a complete fool! You would trust the one who governs beasts of the most unnatural kind!!!"* The harsh, uncaring tone, was unusual to hear from Seraph.

The other friends, under the influence of ale, offered their own raw honesties. But all of them reinforced that ***"they were moving forwards, Wyatt was moving backwards."***

Wyatt seemed hurt by these unanimous sentiments and mustered the courage to offer one last retort, but was cut off by Seraph, who, with an uncharacteristically searing tone, stated, *"Your whole life you've followed us around hoping for defense, never once have you defended others! The path to light is not in self-preservation, but in sacrificing self for others. Protecting the weak is a noble and sworn duty of the righteous, but you can't protect anyone cowering the way that you do!"* During this lecture Seraph's eyes glowed a subtle red as his emotions seemed oddly unhinged for the situation.

The friends, Wyatt, and even Seraph's himself paused in shock, letting the outburst sink in. Wyatt backed away from the table and left without a word.

The entire group lamented what they'd said to Wyatt. After paying their tab, they headed off after him but stopped just outside the tavern as they noticed the medallion of Lykan lying on the ground. Wyatt's medallion.

Wyatt's footsteps led to the docks, usually closed at night, where they found a single boat missing. The party looked at each other with panic in their eyes! Jumping into boats, they all began rowing into the lake, calling out to Wyatt the entire time.

As they reached the other side of the lake, they found Wyatt's boat, but Wyatt was nowhere to be seen. In front of them loomed the Enchanted Forest and from within came the sounds of primal, guttural howls and screams as they did every night. None of the boys could be sure even to this day, but mixed into the sounds they all thought they recognized one scream for a moment.... Wyatt's.

### The Aftermath

Not daring to search the woods at night, the group returned the next day and searched from dawn till dusk, but there was not a single trace of Wyatt to be found anywhere.

They exhausted themselves with missing posters, posting quests on the job board, and consulting diviners over the next year. The rest of the town was saddened to hear the news about an orphan boy committing suicide by entering the woods at night, but on the large the town did not skip a beat.

Silas and Logan had to return to their obligations abroad, but Sorrel and Seraph searched relentlessly for months and months in their free time, but they found nothing.

### A Guilt-Filled Return

Our heroes begin their story with guilt-filled hearts, finally holding a funeral for Wyatt.

They gather together on the anniversary of his disappearance, the very same date they've gathered together every year to celebrate Wyatt but now for the first time in 13 years... Wyatt is not here.
