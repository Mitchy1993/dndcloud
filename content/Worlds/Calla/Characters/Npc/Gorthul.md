**Gorthul's Go-to Disguise**
If Gorthul, as an 8-foot-tall Barlgura, were to use the **Disguise Self** spell to appear less threatening, he would likely choose a disguise that maximizes his ability to blend in while still capitalizing on his large frame. Given his size and the limitations of the spell, he masquerades as either a large *Half-Orc* or a *Loxodon*:

### Gorthul's Go-To [[disguise-self|Disguise Self Usage]] 
A tall imposing Half-orc or Loxodon warrior
- **Height:** Approximately 7 feet tall (the maximum reduction allowed by Disguise Self)
- **Appearance:** Muscular and well-armored, perhaps with a hood or helmet to obscure facial features
- **Clothing:** Worn, travel-stained adventurer’s gear with a cloak to further obscure his size and features
- **Persona:** A stoic, wandering mercenary or veteran soldier
