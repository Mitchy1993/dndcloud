### Arrival in Vesper Falls

- **New Beginnings:** Seraph and his mother Elowen settled in town seeking a fresh start.
- **Evangelizing Spirit:** Seraph's *charismatic(+5)* nature, and open faith in Lumen make him hard to miss, he often needs to be reminded to bridle his enthusiasm

### Personality

- **Ideals:** Seraph is passionate about bringing Lumen's light to all corners of the world.
- **Hobbies:** 
    - Carving random runes into candle wax before melting it down to study the effects
    - Using sand, wood, and smelted ore to craft Sun Star Shuriken's.
- **Flaws:** ***The strain of Lawful-Goodness*** 
    - Seraph strives to be a paragon of patience and light, but we all miss the mark
        - Seraph lacks balance and when he falls short, he fails by a wide margin...
        - Seraph's fervor for goodness, at times, becomes wildly misguided and can take a wild swing into the Chaotic or even Evil alignment for a moment before he is able to self-regulate his emotions.
### Strengths

- **Patron of Light:** Seraph is a proud Warlock of Lumen, he has yet to receive any direct instructions from his patron, however it is obvious that the boy is blessed with gifts of light.
- **Runic Researcher:** While rune carving wax, Seraph accidentally created a special rune capable of ***inflicting wounds*** on the wicked.
- **Light Linguistics:** When Seraph's mind is focused, he often-times can reach through the web of magic that binds all creatures together to understand the meaning and intent of other sentient creatures *(Comprehend Languages)*

### Goals and Aspirations

- **Champion of Light:** Seraph dreams of a world where *light* conquers all *darkness*.
- **Seeking Understanding:** He seeks to comprehend all ***the planes*** and understand the laws that govern ***voluntary*** and ***involuntary*** planar traversal.
