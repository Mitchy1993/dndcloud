# Silas Sylvanus
**Age: 22**
### Arrival in Town/Family Background

- Silas’ parents came to Vesper Falls when Silas was less than a year old. Unusually mysterious for a family of Firbolgs, they quietly settled on the outskirts of the village, slowly losing their identity as beings of the Wild as they blended in with their new neighbors. This became more apparent when, shortly thereafter, they had his younger brother, whom they raised all but completely devoid of Nature’s teachings.

### Silas’ Youth

- While Silas was too young to remember where they came from or why they left, he always felt a subtle pull drawing him away from the village. Vesper Falls was always kind enough to Silas and his family, so he held no ill will, but the village always felt like an extended rest stop on the road, never home. Because of the increasing amount of time he spent in the forest surrounding the village, the only real friends he ever developed close relationships with were Seraph, Sorrel, Logan, and Wyatt.

### Personality/Alignment

- **Silas is Neutral Good**: Generally good-natured, calm, and collected, spiritually inclined. Capable of being caring and tender while also recognizing the value of ‘tough love’.
- Genuinely struggles to understand why people make choices that pull them from the Natural World.

### Ideals

- Respecting and communing with Nature and the Wild itself. Living in harmony with nature the way we were intended to.

### Bonds

- Silas does everything he can to protect the natural world and those who call it home, humanoid and beast alike.

### Flaws

- Silas is young and inexperienced. He’s afraid he’s already missed his opportunity and will never fully become one with nature and the Wilds as he was intended to.
- Struggles with patience for what he perceives to be foolishness on the part of others.
- Is very eager to learn about the natural world and the powers that shaped it, like Lycan and Thero, but woefully ignorant about who and what they actually are.

### Hobbies

- Cooking various meals, treats, etc., from what he finds in the wild. Besides the odd job for money or supplies, he’ll willingly travel into towns or villages to get new recipes.
- Loves exploring/traveling to new places, discovering new environments and creatures he’s never seen before.

### Strengths

- Silas is well-aware of how ignorant he actually is of the Wild and the deities that oversee it. Coupled with his strong attraction to these things, he is more than willing to learn and understand more from whoever can teach him, making him more than willing to reconsider his understanding or preconceptions.
- Silas’ innate pull towards the natural world despite his parents' choices underscores his potential both as a druid and a conduit of the natural world. It just remains to be seen what aspect of the Wild will claim his allegiance… or whom.

### Goals and Aspirations

- Silas wishes to learn all he can about the history and dynamic of the natural world so that he can fully commune and unify himself with it, not just for his own sake, but so that he can stand as a protector of the forest and a shepherd of those who wish to accept Nature’s embrace.
- Silas desperately wants to know the true origins of his family. He wants to understand where he came from so that he can reconcile his parents' choices with what he knows and feels about who he is.
- Silas wants to encounter all the wildlife the world has to offer, because there is no better way to understand all walks of life in the Wild than to literally embody every living being he can.
