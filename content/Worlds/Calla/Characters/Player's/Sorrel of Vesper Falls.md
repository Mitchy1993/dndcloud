# Sorrel of Vespar - Age 23

## Sorrel’s Youth

At only a few hours old, Sorrel was left on the doorstep of the Lunar Haven Orphanage. The headmistress, Lyra, found him swaddled in a midnight blue cloth, with the quill of a short feather pinning it tight.

Years quickly passed, and Sorrel matured. He realized that being of a different race meant most families in Vespar Falls would not adopt him. With no other Owlins around, Sorrel had no one to teach him how to fly.

Rather than dwell on his circumstances, Sorrel chose to see the bright side. Lunar Haven and Vespar Falls were full of friends, food, and protection.

One evening, while perched on the roof of the Haven, Sorrel saw a child with a distraught face being returned to the orphanage. He had never seen anything like it before and immediately felt pity for the boy. After a short introduction, Sorrel promised to introduce Wyatt to all of his amazing friends.

Following their introductions, Sorrel and Wyatt spent every free moment with Sorrel's friends, helping with chores, playing games, or having dinner with their families. Sorrel felt as though the entire village was his family.

As everyone matured, they pursued different goals. Sorrel proudly watched his friends grow and make their decisions. Upon turning 18, Sorrel moved into a second room in Bran's home.

Bran was an older tortle who had spent many years as a fighter and guard to the city. He taught Sorrel the importance of a strong code of honor and the necessity of protecting the people and places he loved.

Sorrel supported himself financially through his masonry work, carving chess pieces from stone and sculpting statues of the local fauna.
