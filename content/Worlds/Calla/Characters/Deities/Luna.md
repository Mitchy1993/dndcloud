## Early Life and Mortal Valor

There is much speculation and debate regarding Luna's existence before her ascension to divinity. However, it is widely agreed that Luna the Lesser was counted among Aries' fiercest and most clever allies. 

Luna could always be found atop her brother Lumen's chariot as they courageously rode into battle. Luna would crush foes beneath her under the overwhelming weight of gravity, only to send them flying off into the sky the very next moment. Those less fortunate would be subject to her celestial wrath as she called down searing beams of radiant light.

## The Retrieval of the Celestial Bodies

Among Luna's greatest deeds was the retrieval of the moon and sun from the Astral Sea and the creation of the stars. Luna, together with Lumen, braved the dangers of the Astral Sea to reclaim these celestial bodies and once again raise them into the sky over Calla.

Legend states that Luna, often the more practical of the two, convinced Lumen to drag the celestial bodies behind his chariot rather than carry them as he had previously insisted. Along this ride, Luna began breaking pieces off the moon and scattering them across the Astral Sea. Her foresight ensured that should the moon ever fail Calla again, the stars would light their way.

It is for this act of devotion and self-sacrifice that Luna ascended to godhood.

## Ascension and Divine Compassion

Although her ascension occurred in days long past, Luna has never forgotten her mortal roots. The mortal races remain near and dear to her heart, and they hold her in particular esteem.

Luna is credited with teaching mortals to navigate using the moon and stars so that they would never again be lost in darkness. Despite all gods being represented in Jubilee, it is the outstretched arms of Luna and Lumen you must walk under when entering the city. They stand stalwart and resolute, welcoming you into the city and beckoning you into their loving embrace.

## Union with Lycan and the Birth of Penny

Shortly after her ascension, Luna caught the eye of one of the newer gods, Lycan. Lycan embarked on a series of perilous trials in hopes of gaining Luna's favor. In the end, it was not the besting of foes that gained Luna's attention, but rather the care and love he displayed for his creation.

Luna and Lycan eventually became partners and gave birth to the youngest member of the pantheon, Penny.

## The Quiet Serenity of the Night

Despite being a ferocious fighter, Luna often prefers the quiet serenity of the night. Some say that on a calm night, when the moonlight strikes the water just right, you can see the reflection of Luna lost in a good book or painting by the Sea of Tranquility.

Many bards have taken to composing at night by the waterside in hopes of catching a glimpse of Luna. This muse of the moon continues to inspire their next great works, her presence a beacon in the tranquil night.
