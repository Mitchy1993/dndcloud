# The God of Light

## Lumen the Lesser

Few records exist of Lumen's time before his ascension to Godhood, yet many legends persist of **Lumen the Lesser**. It is said that Lumen the Lesser was among **Aries' mightiest generals**. So brilliant was his radiance on the battlefield that his opponents would be struck blind at the slightest glance in his direction. Lesser foes would flee before his fiery indignation like darkness from a flame. 

Of this time, one thing is certain: his sister **Luna** would nary stray from his side. She could always be found atop his chariot as they rode together into battle.

## The Ascension of Lumen

Despite his illustrious career as a general, it pales in comparison to his most significant feat: raising the sun from the **Astral Sea**. Lumen, together with Luna, braved the dangers of the Astral Sea to retrieve the Sun and Moon and once again raise them into the sky over Calla. It is for this incredible act of righteousness and self-sacrifice that Lumen ascended to Godhood.

Although his ascension occurred in days long past, Lumen has never forgotten his mortal roots. As such, the mortal races are near and dear to his heart, and they hold him in particular esteem. It is said Lumen is the one who gifted fire to mortalkind.

## Lumen's Legacy

Despite all gods being represented in **Jubilee**, it is the outstretched arms of Lumen and Luna you must walk under when entering the city. They stand stalwart and resolute, welcoming you into the city and beckoning you into their loving embrace.

Lumen also has a particular fondness for horses. Some in Jubilee swear that the sun shines brighter and more gently on the days of a big chariot race, as if Lumen himself were smiling down, watching the events approvingly. Legend states Lumen was gifted a great Nightmare from **Elvira** as a token of their friendship. Outside of Luna, Elvira is Lumen's closest ally among the gods, Elvira being the first mortal ascended to Divinity.

## The Deeds of Lumen

Lumen was ascended to godhood as a reward for his many heroic deeds. As such, Lumen is very interested in the mighty deeds of mortalkind. This has led many down the path of peril in hopes of gaining Lumen's attention and, perhaps more so, his blessing.
