## Discovery
Deep within the heart of the mountain, Sony's pickaxe struck true against the stubborn rock, sending chips flying as he tirelessly mined for rare materials. But as he worked, a sudden rumble shook the cavern, and before he could react, the ground crumbled beneath him, sending him tumbling into darkness.

With a grunt of pain, Sony struggled to his feet, his senses reeling as he took in his surroundings. In the dim light, he spotted a chamber unlike any he had ever seen, ancient runes etched into the walls and a sense of magic hanging heavy in the air.

His eyes widened as they fell upon the treasures within—an iridescent yellow dragon scale gleaming with otherworldly power, and a dormant gray orb resting beside it. Curiosity piqued, Sony reached out, his fingers brushing against the cool surface of the orb. Instantly, the orb whirred to life, hovering before him as its lights flickered to brightness. "Scanning... Scanning... Protocol initiated," it chirped, its voice echoing through the chamber. "You are recognized as the new master. I am at your service." Sony blinked in astonishment, but before the implications of this discovery could sink in the orb pulsed!

*“WARNING: Structural instability detected…”* the orb began to repeat *“WARNING: Structural instability detected… please don the Runemail apparatus and proceed to higher ground”*
With that a beam of energy pulsed from P.O.T.T.S to the yellow scale and then to Sony. Instantly the scale snapped to Sony’s chest, and began expanding into an armor that covered his arms and legs as a helmet snapped shut over his head. 

Immediately, the ground trembled beneath Sony as P.O.T.T.S said “it is time to go!” 

Sony began to sprint for an exit, but was stopped suddenly by the blue orb cutting off his escape

“Master, please do not resist.. I will now attempt to save us“ P.O.T.T.S stated bluntly 

Another blue beam shot into the yellow glowing center of the armor; there was a deafening roar as the cavern came crashing violently inwards and then a brilliant flash of light……..

 …. Sony awoke looking up at the twilight sky, P.O.T.T.S. hovering beside him in silent solidarity. Though the cavern was lost to time, Sony had survived. He knew that it was thanks to the enigmatic orb and the yellow dragon scale pulsing dimly on the ground next to him.

Sony rushed towards his home, knowing no doubt that his father is bound to study these artifacts for weeks on end while Sony and his mother shake their heads at Mr. Tark’s enthusiasm

It was a full days journey back to his hometown, and his parents, Sony couldn’t wait to see them…
## Tark Co. History
Like all artificers, Father could enchant items ***one at a time*** and he would sell them to improve the daily lives of the people, this was *not very profitable* because of the ***time ***it takes to enchant an item. It is far more *lucrative* to specialize in weapons and take military contracts than to make magical wheel chairs for old people. But Father was a good man.

Sony is much more practical, and Tark Co. has become a weapons company, with rising success under Sony's management.

## Schooling <small> Gnomish Arcane Engineering <big>
1. Law of Arcane Conservation: The total magical energy within a closed system remains constant over time, regardless of transformations or manipulations.
2. Principle of Magical Equivalence: For every action spell, there is an equal and opposite reaction spell, resulting in a balance of magical forces.
3. Law of Arcane Entanglement: Two or more magically linked entities will remain correlated in their properties, regardless of the distance separating them, until the magical connection is broken.
4. Law of Dimensional Stability: The structural integrity of dimensional portals and magical gateways is maintained by the precise balance of arcane energies, ensuring stability and preventing collapse.
5. Principle of Enchantment Resonance: Magical items resonate with the essence of their creator, imbuing them with unique properties and characteristics.
6. Law of Spell Iteration: Repeated casting of a spell within a confined space increases the likelihood of magical interference and distortion, leading to unpredictable outcomes.
7. Law of Temporal Dilation: The flow of time within magical constructs or areas of concentrated arcane energy may differ from the standard temporal flow, leading to temporal discrepancies and anomalies.
8. Law of Transmutation Equilibrium: Any attempt to transmute matter or energy must maintain overall balance within the system, preventing the creation or destruction of mass or energy.
9. Principle of Ethereal Synergy: Interaction between the material and ethereal planes follows established patterns of resonance and harmonics, influencing the efficacy of spells and rituals conducted across dimensional boundaries.
10. Law of Magical Flux: The flow of magical energy within a system is subject to fluctuations and variations influenced by environmental conditions, spellcasting proficiency, and the presence of magical conduits or ley lines.
