1. **_Dramatic Player Death_**
    1. While making death saving throws, players can still participate on their turn in the following ways:
        1. Can take an action, but gain _one level of exhaustion_
            - Object interactions, Bonus actions, and Involuntary ability checks all count as actions in this context.)
    - Dropping to 0 hit points _automatically_ accrues *one level of exhaustion
    - Talking is free but, short sentences, you are actively bleeding out.
        - The DM will cut you off, ending your turn, if you are abusing this rule.
    - ***Dying condition**: A named character, who has failed their third death save, lingers one minute as if Stunned & Prone, and can only whisper (barely audible if an adjacent listener stands still the whole round and uses their action to listen). Healing effects do not work on Dying creatures. (This minute is the time period where Revivify works.)*  
        _- If a character is Dying while alone, the DM may optionally extend Dying until their final words can be spoken. (At higher levels, Revivify works for another minute of Dying per slot level above 3rd.)_
2.  **Potions** can be an action or bonus action, but your turn ends when you use one
	1. Drinking a potion with an action yields full healing
3. **Critical Criticals**
	1. Critical hits double your damage dice like normal, except the second dice is maximized automatically
4. Cure Wounds Buff *(One D&D Rule)*
	1. [[cure-wounds|Cure Wounds]] uses 2d8, instead of 1d8, for healing at level 1
5. **More Realistic Combat**
	1. No strategizing ***during*** combat
		- Instead, you have 1 minute in between each round to strategize and then the round starts.
		- Once the round has started there will be no strategizing **You are in combat**
		- If someone is outright egregiously breaking this rule, on purpose, their turn will be forfeited
	2. Players can describe their condition, but do not disclose HP
	3. Standing up from prone provokes opportunity attacks from creatures that can reach
6. **Sleep Deprivation:**
  - Failure to sleep on a proper surface results in a 10% Max HP penalty (rounded down).
  - Debuff removed by a Long Rest with appropriate accommodations.
7. **Food Deprivation**:
	  - Inadequate food leads to a stacking *hungry* debuff:
	    - -1 to all *saving throws*.
	  - After 3 days, *starving* debuff occurs, reducing Max HP by 20% daily until death.
	    - Eating a full meal removes all hunger/starving debuffs.
	    - Eating half a meal removes half of all hunger/starving debuffs.
	    - Eating a snack prevents a stack for that day.
8. **Speedy Turns = Free Short Rest** *(Assign a player to keep track)*
	- Every time a player knows exactly what they want to do when their turn arrives the team will be able progress down a "***Speed Track***"
		- *When the players complete the speed track they may take an instant short rest at the end of battle*
		- *Player's may feel that their turn was speedy, but ultimately because the player's understandably have bias, the DM must be the final say on whether the turn was decisive and earned progress on the speed track.*
			- *Slowing down the game with arguing about the speed track obviously moves the party backwards on the speed track.*
	- Speed Track Length = Total # of players multiplied by 2
9.  [[Facing Rule]]
10. [[Rules on Spell Scrolls]]
11. **Dark Vision Rarity**
	- Dark vision is rare and most races do not have it
	- Your player character's can replace dark vision with an extra skill, language, or even tool proficiency
12. **Initiative Down the River**
	- Once per combat you may deny your turn priority and insert yourself farther down in the round where desired
	- You may never increase your priority, only decrease it.
13. Upon death players may allow their character to die or come back as a revenant with a goal, approved by the DM, and upon completion the character is impossible to revive.  
14. **[[conditions|Condition]] changes**
	- [[conditions#Stunned|Stunned]] creatures have a speed of 0 and take disadvantage on all saves, checks, attacks, etc until the end of the stun.
		- Incapacitation effect removed
		- Other RAW stun effects remain
