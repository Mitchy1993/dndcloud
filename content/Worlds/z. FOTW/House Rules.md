1. **Feats**
    1. If your background does not provide a "Feat," you may add a "Feat," so long as you describe narratively why your character has that "Feat."
    2. "Feats" are no longer tied to classes. You gain "Feats" at Levels 4/8/12/16/19, regardless of their Multi-class composition.
        - Fighters will still gain their bonus "Feats" at *6th* & *14th* **Fighter** levels.
        - Rogues will still gain their bonus Feat at *10th* level.
    3. ***Variant Human Nerf***
        - Variant Humans may not take the following combat Feats as their *Racial Feat*:
            - Crossbow Expert
            - Elven Accuracy
            - Great Weapon Master
            - Lucky
            - Mobile
            - Polearm Master
            - Resilient
            - Sentinel
            - Sharpshooter
            - War Caster
            - etc.
2. **_Dramatic Player Death_**
    1. Dropping to 0 hit points causes a creature to roll on the [[Critical Injury Table]].
    2. While making death saving throws, players can still participate on their turn in the following ways:
        1. Can take an action, but gain _one level of [[conditions#Exhaustion|exhaustion]]_.
            - Object interactions, Bonus actions, and Involuntary ability checks all count as actions in this context.
    3. Talk in short sentences.
    4. ***Dying condition***: A character, who fails their third death save, lingers for one minute as if [[conditions#stunned|Stunned]] & [[conditions#Prone|Prone]], and can only whisper (*an adjacent listener can stand still and use an action to listen*) (*This minute is the time period Revivify works*.)
        - <small> If a character is **Dying** while alone, the DM may optionally extend *Dying* until their final words can be spoken; however, [[revivify]] will not bring them back if 1 minute has passed.</small>
3. **Potions** can be an action or bonus action.
    1. Drinking a potion with an action yields full healing.
4. **Critical Criticals**
    1. Critical hits double your damage dice like normal, except the second dice is maximized automatically.
    2. Gain one [[conditions#exhaustion|exhaustion]] when receiving a critical hit.
5. **Cure Wounds Buff *(One D&D Rule)***
    1. [[cure-wounds|Cure Wounds]] uses 2d8, instead of 1d8, for healing at level 1.
6. **More Realistic Combat**
    1. No strategizing ***during*** combat.
        - Instead, you have 1 minute in between each round to strategize and then the round starts.
        - Once the round has started there will be no strategizing **You are in combat**.
    2. Players can describe their condition, but do not disclose HP.
7. **Sleep Deprivation**
    - Failure to sleep on a proper surface results in a 10% Max HP penalty (rounded down).
    - Debuff removed by a Long Rest with appropriate accommodations.
8. **Food Deprivation**
    - Inadequate food leads to a stacking *hungry* debuff:
        - -1 to all *saving throws*.
    - After 3 days, *starving* debuff occurs, reducing Max HP by 20% daily until death.
        - Eating a full meal removes all hunger/starving debuffs.
        - Eating half a meal removes half of all hunger/starving debuffs.
        - Eating a snack prevents a stack for that day.
9. [[Facing Rule]]
10. [[Rules on Spell Scrolls]]
11. **Dark Vision Rarity**
    - Dark vision is rare and most races do not have it.
    - Your player character can replace dark vision with an extra skill, language, or even tool proficiency.
12. **Initiative Down the River**
    - Once per combat you may deny your turn priority and insert yourself farther down in the round where desired.
    - You may never increase your priority, only decrease it.
13. Upon death, players may allow their character to die or come back as a revenant with a goal, approved by the DM, and upon completion, the character is impossible to revive.
14. **[[conditions|Condition]] changes**
    1. [[conditions#Stunned|Stunned]] creatures have a speed of 0 and take disadvantage on all saves, checks, attacks, etc. until the end of the stun.
        - Incapacitation effect removed.
        - Other RAW stun effects remain.
    2. [[conditions#Paralyzed|Paralyzed]] creatures have a speed of 0 and take disadvantage on all saves, checks, attacks, etc. until the end of paralysis.
        - Incapacitation effect removed.
        - Other RAW paralysis effects remain.
    3. [[conditions#Surprised|Surprised]]
        - Surprised creatures roll initiative at disadvantage.
        - Surprised creatures cannot use reactions until their first turn of combat.
