## **Mission 1: Underdark Investigation**

"Welcome, recruits, to the Waterdahvian Arcane Shield Platoon. You are about to embark on a critical journey alongside our seasoned operatives. Today, you will be presented with the details of three missions. Afterward, you will have the opportunity to join one of these missions and shadow our veterans in the field.

Our first mission is one of grave importance. A team of our finest is tasked with investigating a disturbance in the Underdark beneath our very city, Waterdeep.

Reports have surfaced indicating that a terrorist cell, driven by malicious intent, is plotting to poison the aquifers from which Waterdeep draws its lifeblood. These are not mere rumors but credible threats that could jeopardize the well-being of every soul in our city.

Your role will be to shadow this team as they delve into the depths of the Underdark. They will begin by confirming the veracity of these reports at the specified location. This is no simple reconnaissance. The team must act swiftly and decisively to neutralize this cell and prevent any contamination of our water supply.

Understand this: the Underdark is a perilous realm. It is a place of darkness and danger, where every step could bring you face-to-face with deadly creatures or treacherous terrain. But within these shadows, our mission is clear: to safeguard Waterdeep from those who would do it harm.

You will observe the veterans as they navigate this perilous environment, gather intelligence, and engage with the enemy. Your objective is to learn, to understand the intricacies of such operations, and to be ready to act should the need arise.

Prepare yourselves. The safety of Waterdeep may very well depend on the success of this mission. Now, consider carefully which mission you wish to shadow, for each presents its own unique challenges and opportunities to prove your worth."

## **Mission 2: Kiira N'vaelahr Escort**

"Recruits, our second mission is one of subtlety and vigilance. Your task will be to accompany a team assigned to the transportation of a precious artifact: the Kiira N'vaelahr.

This artifact, an ancient elven gem of immense power and significance, must be safely delivered from Waterdeep to a hidden city in the High Moors known as Rhymanthiin. This city, often referred to as the City of Hope, is a place shrouded in mystery and magic, and it is there that the Kiira N'vaelahr belongs.

The transport team will be reinforced by a detachment of wizards provided by the Blackstaff herself, Vajra Safar. These wizards are among the most skilled in Waterdeep, and their presence will ensure the Kiira is protected against any magical threats we might encounter along the way.

However, the success of this mission hinges not on our strength, but on our ability to move discreetly. We must maintain a low profile throughout the journey to avoid drawing undue attention from those who would seek to seize the artifact for their own nefarious purposes.

Your role will be to shadow this escort team, observing their strategies and tactics for maintaining security and discretion in such a high-stakes mission. You will see firsthand how to manage both the mundane and the magical aspects of a covert operation. This means being prepared for everything from evading common highwaymen to countering scrying spells and other forms of magical surveillance.

The journey to the High Moors is perilous in its own right. The path to Rhymanthiin takes us through rugged terrain and into the unknown. The mission will be deemed successful once we reach the High Moors and hand over the Kiira to the wizards who can then complete the final leg of the journey into the hidden city.

Remember, this mission is about finesse and subtlety. It is an opportunity to learn the art of moving unseen, of blending in with the shadows, and ensuring that our presence and purpose remain undiscovered until our task is complete.

As with the first mission, consider carefully which path you wish to follow. Each journey holds its own lessons, and each success is a step towards becoming a full member of the Waterdavian Arcane Shield Platoon."

## **Mission 3: Investigating Unusual Deaths in the North Ward**

"Recruits, our third and final mission is somewhat unconventional and falls outside our usual remit, yet it demands our immediate attention due to its location and the unease it has stirred among the Lords of Waterdeep.

We have received an urgent request for assistance from the Guild of Apothecaries and Physicians. They are seeking our forensics and data analysis expertise to investigate a series of peculiar and unexplained deaths at the House of Healing, a well-respected institution right here in the North Ward.

This mission, while it may seem less perilous than the others, is no less critical. The North Ward is renowned for its safety and tranquility, and these sudden fatalities have shaken the community to its core. Chief Physician Doctor Lockwood, a man not given to hysteria, is convinced that foul play is at hand. His suspicions lean towards homicide, a grave claim that casts a shadow over our city's supposed sanctum of peace.

Given the sensitive nature of these events and the direct impact on Waterdeep's reputation, the Lords of Waterdeep have pressured us into action. When they are uncomfortable, my job—and by extension, yours—becomes considerably more challenging.

For this task, only you, our recruits, will be dispatched. I have decided not to allocate our specialized veterans to this mission, as I believe their skills are better reserved for threats that lie outside the city's walls. Instead, this will be an opportunity for you to step into the breach, to demonstrate your analytical prowess and investigative acumen.

Your objective is clear: you will delve into the circumstances surrounding these deaths. This will involve gathering evidence, analyzing forensic data, and interviewing witnesses and staff at the House of Healing. You must piece together the clues and discern whether these deaths are the result of malicious intent or a series of unfortunate coincidences.

Understand that while this mission may not involve direct combat or dark magic, it is no less dangerous. Deception, intrigue, and potentially deadly schemes await you, masked by the very walls meant to protect the sick and vulnerable.

Take this mission seriously. The safety of our fellow citizens and the peace of our city rest on your shoulders.

Consider this final option carefully. It is a chance to prove your capabilities, to show that even as recruits, you are ready to uphold the standards of the Waterdavian Arcane Shield Platoon."

## **Deliberation Time**

Commander Lightshield’s gaze sweeps over the recruits, his words hanging heavily in the air. After a moment of silence, he continues:

"Recruits, you now have ten minutes to break into your squads and deliberate on which mission you wish to shadow. Choose wisely and return to me with your decision."

With that, Commander Lightshield dismisses you, leaving you and your fellow recruits to discuss and decide your path forward.
