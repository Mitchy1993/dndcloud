### Hello Intrepid Heroes
SO now that I officially graduated from school, as of yesterday, I would like to get serious about DMing & the only way to do that is to get the hard fact's on all of the things I'm doing wrong as a new DM and make good habits going forward. 

I have prepared a short questionaire to be filled out by every single player and this will need to be completed before we schedule another session.
*(Ironically the first thing I do after finishing school is start assigning homework, **what have I become...**)*

Please be honest, you absolutely know the moments where you are not having as much fun as you could. Focus on the times you've had that feeling and stew on them for a bit. Once you've locked in on those moments, decide why you felt that way and how you think the situation could have been made better by the DM*(me)* and then put that in your answer.
@everyone

## Questions:

### - What part of last session did you enjoy?
### - What was your least favorite part of last session?
### - How did you feel about combat? Did it feel too slow? Too easy?
### - How did you feel about roleplay? Did you feel you had enough time dedicated to it? Did you feel free to express yourself?
### - How do you feel about this one-shot in general? Does it feel like it’s moving at a good pace? What concerns would you have if this were a campaign?
### - What are your hopes for the next session?
### - Anything else you’d like to talk about or mention?
@everyone

*Please consider the aforementioned questions, and then dm the answers to me* @everyone
