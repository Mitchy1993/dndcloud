```ad-hint
Any time you get items write them down in your notes or in fight club 5e. I might not, so if I don't have it and you don't have it that item is just lost.. *cuz nobody knows what it was*

I need your spell lists, fight club 5e will do it for you with character sheet

Remind follow up with anyone who still needs feat, asi, or magic item
```

```ad-tip
Personal reminder - Put out spell cards for player charcters to answer their questions in game
