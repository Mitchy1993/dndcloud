# How do I create a background?

### DO NOT STRESS
*You do NOT need to answer all of these questions:* 
- *Simply answer what speaks to you!* 
- *Any answers can be edited and changed throughout the development of your character.*
- *You can send me as many ideas or rough drafts as you want.*
### **What do you want?**
  - Are you trying to progress towards something?
  - Why is it important to you?

### Family History
- Do you have any important friends or family?

### Connections
- Do you have any connections, past or present, with other party members? 
	- *You could be a long lost relative, parent, childhood friend, etc.*

### Traits
- What do you *hate*?
- What do you *love*?
- What do you *fear*?

### Flaw
- Whatâ€™s something you need to work on or that you *struggle* with from your past or present?

### Quirks
- Catchphrases in combat?
- Allergies to Pixie dust??
- Always greets trees as if they are people???

### Class
- Is there flavor for your character that would make them different from a normal version of this class?
## Personal Mystery

- **Mystery/Plot Hole:** *This is fun because you create the mystery, and I create the answer which you will only find out as the journey unfolds*
	- Examples:
		- *You can't shake the feeling that you were once part of a secret organization that you can't remember.* 
			- *What happened to your memories of this organization, and what dark secrets lie within your forgotten past?*
