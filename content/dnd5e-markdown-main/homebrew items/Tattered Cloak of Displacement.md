*Wondrous Item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Requires Attunement

While you wear this cloak, it projects an illusion that makes you appear to be standing in a place near your actual location, causing any creature to have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. 

If you take damage, the property ceases to function until the start of your *Short* or *Long Rest*. 

*This property is suppressed while you are [incapacitated](conditions.md#incapacitated), [restrained](conditions.md#restrained), or otherwise unable to move.*
