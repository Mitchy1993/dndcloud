# Weapon (Longsword) Artifact

*Requires attunement by a spellcaster of good alignment* **(1 hour)**

**Galadris** is a longsword of delicate elven craftsmanship, crafted at an open forge beneath the night sky with the full moon shining upon it by the first drow to reach the surface in good faith. Its thin, long blade resonated with their songs, as if the sword was singing on its own and answering their prayers to Eilistraee. It is the first one of the so-called singing swords, special blessed weapons wielded by the best and most graceful warriors amongst Eilistraee's worshippers, nowadays known as the Sword Dancers due to their dance-like fighting style.

Galadris is made of pure mithril, with a gem in the shape of a crescent moon inlaid in the center of its elegantly curved crossguard. Its long, thin blade is engraved with elven runes and always emits a faint aura of silvery light. Its scabbard is no less ornate, crafted from jet-black leather with mithril reinforcements and inlaid with gems at its tip and mouth.

## Sentience
Galadris is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 10, a Wisdom of 20, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder's hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate more explicitly through visions or dreams when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep.

### Personality
Galadris seeks the redemption of the drow, wanting to protect them from the influence of Lolth and her demonic servants. It desires them to become an accepted race of surface-dwelling creatures like most other kinds of elves. It also seeks the advancement of Eilistraee's elven ideals such as art, dancing, and singing. Once bonded to an owner who shares its ideals and cares for the drow as the sword does, it will serve them loyally as long as they remain a faithful follower of Eilistraee. Like drow themselves, the sword does not like daylight but cherishes the silvery glow of moonlight shining upon its blade.

## Dormant
The longsword grants you the following properties while in its dormant state:

- The sword has the [[finesse]] and [[light weapon]] properties.
- You gain a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
- When you hit a fiend or undead with an attack with this weapon, it deals an additional 1d8 radiant damage.
- **Song of the New Moon:** While you are holding Galadris, its blade resonates and gives off a faint singing. While you can hear the sword's song, you cannot be charmed or frightened. Moreover, each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you and can hear the sword's song has advantage on saving throws it makes to avoid being charmed or frightened or to end those conditions on itself.
- **Silverlight Aura:** The sword emits dim, silvery light in a 30-foot radius. This light is moonlight. Fiends and undead within the aura are always outlined in the light, meaning they cannot benefit from being invisible.

## Awakened
The longsword grants you the following properties while in its awakened state:

- You gain a +20 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
- The additional radiant damage against fiends and undead increases to 2d8.
- You gain proficiency in the Acrobatics and Performance skills. If you already are proficient in one or both of those skills, you can instead add twice your proficiency bonus to any ability check that uses this skill.
- **Moonfire Magic:** While you are holding the sword, you can cast one of the following spells (using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus) either as an action or, when you take the attack action on your turn, in place of one of your attacks: dancing lights, green-name blade, guiding bolt, magic missile, or word of radiance. You can cast these spells at will at their base level or use your spell slots to cast them at higher levels.
- **Song of the Ascending Moon:** The sword's song becomes stronger and clearer. From now on, while you can hear the sword's song, you have resistance to psychic damage and advantage on saving throws against divination spells. Moreover, each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you that can hear the sword's song cannot be charmed or frightened.

## Exalted
The longsword grants you the following properties while in its exalted state:

- You gain a +30 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
- The additional radiant damage against fiends and undead increases to 3d8.
- **Eilistraee's Grace:** Your movement becomes fluid and dance-like while you are holding the sword. You are always under the effect of a freedom of movement spell and when you hit a creature with the sword, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity from it until the end of the turn. In addition, once per day the sword may cast haste on you if it feels you might need its aid. When it does so, the sword maintains concentration so you don't have to.
- **Song of the Full Moon:** The sword's song becomes stunningly beautiful and strong, shielding you from any divination magic and from any effect that would affect your mind as if you were under the effect of a mind blank spell as long as you can hear it. In addition, at the end of your turn, you and each creature within 30 feet of you that can hear the sword's song gain 3d8 temporary hit points.

## Random Properties
Galadris in its dormant state has one minor beneficial property and one minor detrimental property. When the sword attains an awakened state, it gains an additional minor beneficial property and an additional minor detrimental property. When the sword reaches its exalted state, it gains a major beneficial property.

## Destroying the Sword
Galadris can only be destroyed during a full moon. At least nine sword-dancers must come together, each of them wielding their own singing sword, and they must perform a prayer to Eilistraee, vowing that they have done everything they could to save the drow from Lolth and that the sword has fulfilled its purpose. Only if Eilistraee accepts, the sword then can be molten down in the same forge it was born from.

Proficiency with a longsword allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it.
