**Rarity:** Rare
**Type:** Ring

*Description: This slender ring is adorned with a single, shimmering gemstone that seems to glow with an inner fire. Ancient runes etched into the band pulse faintly with arcane energy, hinting at the powerful magic contained within.*

**Effect:** 
As a ***reaction*** immediately after making a "successful" melee attack, the wearer can activate the Ring of Reckless Precision. Upon activation, the attack they just made becomes an automatic ***critical hit***. Furthermore, *all subsequent melee attacks made by the wearer during that round are also considered automatic critical hits.*

**Drawback:** The immense strain of channeling such power takes a toll on the wearer's body. For ***each attack*** made using the ring's power, the wearer gains ***2 levels of exhaustion.***


### History
Legends speak of a master enchanter who sought to create a weapon of unparalleled precision and devastation. Unable to imbue his creation with the necessary power directly, he instead crafted this ring to channel the raw energy of [[Acheron]] itself. While the Ring of Reckless Precision grants its wearer immense strength, it also demands a heavy price for wielding its formidable power.

**Additional Notes:**  
Although many seek it's terrifying power, the ring has never in history been taken from it's owner by force. The relinquishing of the ring, historically, has reliably followed the collapsing of the mind and body of the wearer.

### Inscription <small>*(Dwarvish)*<big>
*"In the heat of battle, wielder beware,* 
*A power you gain, a burden you bear* 
*In striking true, strength unfurls,* 
*Behold the price of hurling worlds."*
