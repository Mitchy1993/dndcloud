Shoes is a pair of boots that slip on and off quickly and easily if desired by the wearer. They deal psychic damage and return to the wearer's feet, if desired, after being thrown.

*These shoes were formerly enchanted to return to their owner's feet. This caused a great deal of trouble for owners, who, while wearing a slipper or a nice heeled number, kept being kicked in the ankles by jealous footwear.*
