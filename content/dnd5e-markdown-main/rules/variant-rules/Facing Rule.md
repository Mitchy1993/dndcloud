# Optional Rule: Facing

## Facing Directions
Each creature has a forward-facing direction that affects its ability to see and defend against threats. This direction is typically the direction in which the creature is focused during combat.

- **Forward (Front)**: The direction a creature is facing, covering a 180-degree arc in front.
- **Behind (Rear)**: The area directly behind the creature, covering a 180-degree arc opposite to its forward direction.
	- Attacks at the rear of an enemy are made with advantage 

## Movement and Facing
- A creature can change its facing as part of its movement on its turn.
- Turning to face a new direction doesn't consume movement but must occur during the creature's move.
- A creature must decide its facing direction at the end of its movement each turn.

## Shield Coverage
- Shields provide their Armor Class (AC) bonus only to attacks originating from the front 180-degree arc.
- Attacks from the sides or rear do not benefit from the shield's AC bonus.

## Opportunity Attacks and Facing
- Opportunity attacks are not affected by facing and can occur regardless of the direction of movement.
### Simulate Fighting for an Advantage in Melee Combat
- **Triggered Opportunity Attack**: When an enemy enters or starts its turn in the front 180-degree arc of an enemies reach and tries moves to past them around to the rear without first leaving the creature's reach, it triggers a free opportunity attack.
- **No Reaction Required**: This attack does not require the creature to use its reaction.
- **Once Per Round**: A creature can only gain this free opportunity attack once per round.
